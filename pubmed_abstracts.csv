Predictive factors for treatment outcomes with intravitreal anti-vascular endothelial growth factor injections in diabetic macular edema in clinical practice.,International journal of retina and vitreous,2023 Apr 4,37016462,"BACKGROUND: Intravitreal anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) injections are the standard of care for diabetic macular edema (DME), a common complication of diabetes. This study aimed to identify factors influencing DME intravitreal anti-VEGF treatment outcomes in real-world practice. METHODS: This was a multi-center retrospective observational study using medical chart review of participants receiving anti-VEGF injections for DME (N = 248). Demographic and clinical variables were assessed for association with best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) and central macular thickness (CMT) outcomes using regression models. RESULTS: There was a significant improvement in BCVA (p < 0.001) and CMT (p < 0.001) after 12 months of treatment, although 21% of participants had decreased BCVA, and 41% had a < 10% CMT reduction at 12 months. Higher baseline BCVA (p = 0.022, OR=-0.024, 95% CI=-0.046,-0.004) and longer duration of diabetic retinopathy (p = 0.048, OR=-0.064, 95% CI=-0.129,-0.001) were negative predictors for BCVA response, whereas Aflibercept treatment (p = 0.017, OR = 1.107, 95% CI = 0.220,2.051) compared with other drugs and a positive ""early functional response"" (p < 0.001, OR=-1.393, 95% CI=-1.946,-0.857) were positive predictors. A higher baseline CMT (p < 0.001, OR = 0.019, 95% CI = 0.012,0.0261) and an ""early anatomical response"", (p < 0.001, OR=-1.677, 95% CI=-2.456, -0.943) were predictors for greater reduction in CMT. Overall, the variables could predict only 23% of BCVA and 52% of CMT response. CONCLUSIONS: The study shows a significant proportion of DME patients do not respond to anti-VEGF therapy and identifies several clinical predictors for treatment outcomes. TRIAL REGISTRATION: The study was approved through the Human Research Ethics Committee, University of Tasmania (approval number H0012902), and the Southern Adelaide Clinical Human Research Ethics Committee (approval number 86 - 067)."
Time outdoors positively associates with academic performance: a school-based study with objective monitoring of outdoor time.,BMC public health,2023 Apr 4,37016357,"BACKGROUND: To explore the relationship between outdoor time and academic performance among school-aged children. METHODS: This study was designed as a cross-sectional study. Data were derived from a school-based prospective children myopia intervention study (STORM). Outdoor time was recorded by self-developed algorithm-validated wristwatches in real-time and calculated as the cumulative average of 10 months. The academic performance was recorded and provided by the participating schools and further standardized. Other information was collected using an online standardized questionnaire. Mixed-effects model and B-Spline method were used to investigate the association between time spent on different types of daily activity, including outdoor activity and academic performance. RESULTS: A total of 3291 children with mean age 9.25 years were included in the final analysis. Overall, outdoor time was associated with academic performance in a non-linear manner; specifically, not exceeding 2.3 h per day, outdoor time was positively associated with academic performance; exceeding 2.3 h per day, this association became non-significant. Likewise, daily sleep duration and out-of-school learning time were associated with academic performance in a non-linear manner, resulting in turning points of 11.3 and 1.4 h per day, respectively. Separate analysis showed that outdoor time and sleep duration but not out-of-school learning time were positively associated with academic performance in Chinese, mathematics and English. CONCLUSION: Outdoor time, sleep duration and out-of-school learning time were associated with academic performance in a non-linear manner. Promotion of outdoor time may not negatively impact on academic performance. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Our study was registered in ClinicalTrials.gov (Identifier: NCT02980445)."
"China Glaucoma Treatment Pattern Study I-Primary Angle-Closure Glaucoma: protocol for a multicentre, retrospective, observational study.",BMJ open,2023 Apr 4,37015785,"INTRODUCTION: Primary angle-closure glaucoma (PACG) is a leading cause of irreversible blindness globally, and the number of patients with PACG rises every year. Yet, there is a lack of knowledge about the clinical characteristics, therapeutic options and profile of patients with PACG in China. Hence, we design the China Glaucoma Treatment Pattern Study Ⅰ-Primary Angle-Closure Glaucoma (Ch-GTPⅠ). The objective of this paper is to describe the design and methodology of Ch-GTP. The aim of this study is to characterise the profile and trend associated with initial PACG treatment for the last 10 years in China. METHODS: Ch-GTPⅠ is a national multicentre retrospective observational study that will randomly sample from 50 hospitals throughout China. Over 7000 patient records hospitalised for initial PACG treatment from 2011 to 2020 will be selected randomly. The data from electronic medical records will be uploaded to an encrypted online platform that will receive and collate data from all collaborating hospitals. Data abstraction and monitoring will be performed in a standardised manner by trained statisticians to ensure consistency. Systematic data cleaning will also be conducted by statisticians to ensure data integrity before final data storage. The outcomes will include four broad categories: (1) demographics, (2) clinical characteristics, (3) therapeutic strategies and procedures and (4) early outcomes at discharge. The demographic characteristics and early outcomes will be summarised using descriptive statistics. Comparative analyses of characteristics and treatment pattern changing trends for different regions and years will be used to test for significant differences (t-test or Mann-Whitney U test). ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The collaborating hospitals obtained local approval based on a standard ethics application from internal ethics committees or acknowledged an existent ethics approval of the leading institution with approval from internal ethics committees. Due to the retrospective nature, written informed consent from patients was waived by the ethics committee. The results will be published in academic journals and presented at national and international academic conferences. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: ChiCTR2100054643."
Unclassified clinical presentations of chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy.,"Journal of neurology, neurosurgery, and psychiatry",2023 Apr 4,37015771,"BACKGROUND: To assess the ability of the 2021 European Academy of Neurology/Peripheral Nerve Society (EAN/PNS) clinical criteria for chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy (CIDP) to include within their classification the whole spectrum of clinical heterogeneity of the disease and to define the clinical characteristics of the unclassifiable clinical forms. METHODS: The 2021 EAN/PNS clinical criteria for CIDP were applied to 329 patients fulfilling the electrodiagnostic (and in some cases also the supportive) criteria for the diagnosis of CIDP. Clinical characteristics were reviewed for each patient not strictly fulfilling the clinical criteria ('unclassifiable'). RESULTS: At study inclusion, 124 (37.5%) patients had an unclassifiable clinical presentation, including 110 (89%) with a typical CIDP-like clinical phenotype in whom some segments of the four limbs were unaffected by weakness ('incomplete typical CIDP'), 10 (8%) with a mild distal, symmetric, sensory or sensorimotor polyneuropathy confined to the lower limbs with cranial nerve involvement ('cranial nerve predominant CIDP') and 4 (1%) with a symmetric sensorimotor polyneuropathy limited to the proximal and distal areas of the lower limbs ('paraparetic CIDP'). Eighty-one (65%) patients maintained an unclassifiable presentation during the entire disease follow-up while 13 patients progressed to typical CIDP. Patients with the unclassifiable clinical forms compared with patients with typical CIDP had a milder form of CIDP, while there was no difference in the distribution patterns of demyelination. CONCLUSIONS: A proportion of patients with CIDP do not strictly fulfil the 2021 EAN/PNS clinical criteria for diagnosis. These unclassifiable clinical phenotypes may pose diagnostic challenges and thus deserve more attention in clinical practice and research."
A randomized clinical trial comparing three fixed combinations of bimatoprost with timolol in patients with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension.,Current medical research and opinion,2023 Apr 4,37013445,"Objective: To compare the efficacy and safety of two fixed combination, preservative-free eye drops (bimatoprost 0.01% in combination with either timolol 0.1% or 0.5%) in a gel formulation, with bimatoprost 0.03%/timolol 0.5% in patients with open-angle glaucoma (OAG) or ocular hypertension (OHT).Methods: Phase II, randomized, investigator-masked, multicenter, 3-arm parallel group (Eudract No. 2017-002823-46). Eighty-six patients aged >/=18 years with OAG or OHT, with intraocular pressure (IOP) initially controlled for at least 6 months by a combination therapy of a dual prostaglandin and timolol or insufficiently controlled by first-line monotherapy were included. Patients were randomized to receive T4030a (bimatoprost 0.01%/timolol 0.1%; N = 29), T4030c (bimatoprost 0.01%/timolol 0.5%; N = 29) or bimatoprost 0.03%/timolol 0.5% (N = 28), administered once daily in the evening for 12 weeks. Primary endpoint was defined as change in IOP from day 1 to week 12 measured at 08:00 (+/-1 hour). Further efficacy, safety and pharmacokinetic endpoints were assessed as secondary outcomes.Results: The mean change in IOP from baseline to week 12 was -9.8 +/- 2.1 mmHg for T4030a, -10.1 +/- 2.5 mmHg for T4030c and -10.0 +/- 2.8 mmHg for bimatoprost 0.03%/timolol 0.5%. All treatments were well tolerated with no safety issues identified in any group. In patients treated with T4030a, the systemic concentration of timolol was significantly lower after 12 weeks than in patients treated with T4030c or bimatoprost 0.03%/timolol0.5%.Conclusions: These study results suggest that the preservative-free ophthalmic formulation of T4030a (bimatoprost 0.01%/timolol 0.1%) can be regarded as a useful tool in the therapeutic management of OAG and OHT."
Sensitivity and specificity of optical coherence tomography angiography for diagnosis and classification of diabetic retinopathy; a systematic review and meta-analysis.,European journal of ophthalmology,2023 Apr 3,37013361,"BACKGROUND: Optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) is a noninvasive imaging method that can be used for the staging of diabetic retinopathy. In addition, alterations in OCTA parameters can precede the clinical fundus changes. In this review, we aimed to assess the accuracy of OCTA in diagnosis and staging of diabetic retinopathy. METHODS: Two independent reviewers participated in the literature search using electronic databases (PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library Central Register of Controlled Trials, ISI, and Scopus) from inception till December 2020. The heterogeneity of data was assessed by Q statistics, Chi-square test and I(2) index. RESULTS: Forty-four articles published from 2015 to the end of 2020 were included in this meta-analysis. Of these, 27 were case-control studies, 9 were case series, and 8 were cohort studies. In total, 4284 eyes of 3553 patients were assessed in this study. OCTA could differentiate diabetic retinopathy from diabetes without diabetic retinopathy with a sensitivity of 88% (95% CI: 85% to 92%) and specificity of 88% (95% CI: 85% to 91%). In addition, it could differentiate proliferative diabetic retinopathy from non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy with a sensitivity of 91% (95% CI: 86% to 95%) and specificity of 91% (95% CI:86% to 96%). The sensitivity of OCTA for diagnosing diabetic retinopathy was increased by the size of scan (3 x 3 mm: 85%; 6 x 6 mm: 91%, 12 x 12 mm: 96%). CONCLUSION: OCTA, as a non-invasive method, has acceptable sensitivity and specificity for diagnosis and classification of diabetic retinopathy. A larger scan size is associated with more sensitivity for discriminating diabetic retinopathy."
[Research progress on the epidemiology and risk factors of dry eye in children].,[Zhonghua yan ke za zhi] Chinese journal of ophthalmology,2023 Apr 11,37012598,"The prevalence of dry eye in children is increasing with changes in the environment and the widespread use of electronic products. However, due to poor ability to express themselves and hidden symptoms of children, lack of understanding of dry eye in children, children with dry eye are likely to be misdiagnosed. Dry eye can seriously affect the quality of children's learning, life, vision and visual development. Therefore, it is urgent to raise awareness of clinical workers about dry eye in children, prevent the occurrence of related complications of dry eye, and avoid permanent visual damage to children. This review discusses and summarizes the epidemiology and common risk factors of children with dry eye, with the aim of improving doctors' understanding of dry eye in children."
[Femtosecond laser-assisted minimally invasive lamellar keratoplasty for advanced keratoconus].,[Zhonghua yan ke za zhi] Chinese journal of ophthalmology,2023 Apr 11,37012592,"Objective: To evaluate the initial safety and efficacy of femtosecond laser-assisted minimally invasive lamellar keratoplasty (FL-MILK) for advanced keratoconus. Methods: It was a case series study. Patients with advanced keratoconus who underwent FL-MILK between August 2017 and April 2020 at Shandong Eye Hospital were prospectively included. The femtosecond laser was used to create an intrastromal pocket in the recipient cornea and a lamellar cornea in the donor. The lamellar cornea was then gently inserted into the intrastromal pocket through the incision and flattened. Clinical measurements included best-corrected visual acuity, 3-mm anterior corneal mean keratometry, anterior and posterior central corneal elevation, central corneal thickness, corneal biomechanics, and endothelial cell density. The follow-up was conducted at 1 month, 12 months, and 24 months after the operation. Results: There were 33 patients (35 eyes) in the study. Twenty-six patients were male and 7 patients were female. The mean age was (20.34+/-5.24) years old. All patients completed 12 months of follow-up, and 25 patients (27 eyes) completed 24 months of follow-up. No epithelial ingrowth, infection, or allogeneic rejection was observed. Compared with the preoperative data, the anterior central corneal elevation significantly decreased (P<0.001), the mean keratometry significantly decreased (P<0.05), and the central corneal thickness significantly increased (P<0.001). The corneal biomechanical strength was significantly improved, with the deformation amplitude ratio at 2.0 mm decreasing from 1.39+/-0.14 preoperatively to 1.21+/-0.10 at 24 months postoperatively (P<0.001) and the stiffness parameter at the first applanation increasing from 41.49+/-11.47 preoperatively to 88.41+/-18.17 at 24 months postoperatively (P<0.001). There were no significant changes in the mean best-corrected visual acuity, posterior corneal elevation, mean spherical equivalent, and endothelial cell density (all P>0.05). Conclusions: FL-MILK may be a feasible option for advanced keratoconus. This procedure may provide a new resolution for keratoconus."
[Analysis of clinical manifestations and imaging characteristics of in vivo confocal microscopy for Nocardia keratitis].,[Zhonghua yan ke za zhi] Chinese journal of ophthalmology,2023 Apr 11,37012591,"Objective: To analyze the clinical manifestations and imaging characteristics of in vivo confocal microscopy (IVCM) for Nocardia keratitis. Methods: It was a retrospective case series study. Medical records of 16 consecutive patients (16 eyes) with Nocardia keratitis were collected from the Department of Ophthalmology at Beijing Tongren Hospital, Capital Medical University between 2018 and 2022. The group consisted of 11 males and 5 females. The inclusion criteria for the study were the presence of typical clinical manifestations of Nocardia keratitis and at least one positive pathogenic test (corneal scraping or microbial culture) indicating Nocardia infection. The medical history, clinical and microbiological examination data of the patients were analyzed, including risk factors, diagnosis time, clinical manifestations, diagnostic methods, strain isolation, cure time, and best corrected visual acuity before and after treatment. This study utilized techniques such as slit lamp microscopy, in vivo confocal microscopy (IVCM), scraping cytology, microbial culture, and mass spectrometry identification. Results: The main risk factors for Nocardia keratitis included plant or foreign body injuries (5 out of 16 cases), contact lens use (4 out of 16 cases), and surgery (2 out of 16 cases). The average time to diagnosis was (20.8+/-11.8) days, with the shortest time being 8 days and the longest being 60 days. The best corrected visual acuity was less than 0.05 in 7 patients, between 0.05 to 0.3 in 7 patients, and greater than or equal to 0.3 in 2 patients. The typical symptoms included superficial gray-white infiltration in a wreath-like pattern on the cornea, corneal ulcers with dry and gray-white necrotic tissue coverage, and in severe cases, corneal ulcer perforation. Nocardia corneal infection was identified in 12 out of 16 cases by scraping cytology, 9 out of 16 cases by mass spectrometry, and 8 out of 16 cases by both methods. IVCM showed the presence of fine and moderately reflective filamentous hyphae in the subepithelial and superficial stromal layer of the cornea, arranged in elongated, beaded, and branched structures. Infiltration of many hyper-reflective round inflammatory cells was also seen around the hyphae. Fourteen cases were treated with medication and 2 cases were treated with corneal transplantation. The average cure time was (37.5+/-25.2) days and there were no cases of recurrence during the follow-up period (all greater than 6 months). Conclusions: Nocardia keratitis is primarily characterized by dense, round, or wreath-like infiltration in the early stage, and by gray-white dry necrotic secretion and hypopyon on the surface of corneal ulcers in the middle and late stages. Fine, branched or beaded, and moderately reflective filamentous structures are the hallmark of the corneal lesion on the IVCM images."
[A multicenter clinical trial of collar-button type keratoprosthesis implantation for the treatment of corneal blindness in high-risk transplantation].,[Zhonghua yan ke za zhi] Chinese journal of ophthalmology,2023 Apr 11,37012589,"Objective: To evaluate the efficiency and safety of collar-button type keratoprosthesis (c-bKPro) implantation for corneal blindness in high-risk transplantation in China. Methods: It was a case series study. High-risk corneal blind patients who planned to undergo c-bKPro implantation were prospectively and continuously enrolled in the Eye Hospital of Shandong First Medical University, Ophthalmology Division of Chinese PLA General Hospital, Zhongshan Ophthalmic Center, Department of Ophthalmology in Eye & ENT Hospital of Fudan University, and Eye Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University from July 2019 to January 2020. The cure for blindness and surgical success were assessed based on visual acuity (VA)>/=0.05. The complications and keratoprosthesis retention rate were recorded to determine the safety of the surgery. Results: Thirty-seven subjects (eyes) were included, of which 32 were male and 5 were female, aged 27 to 72 years old. The indications of c-bKPro implantation were corneal graft failure (21 eyes, 56.8%), chemical injury (8 eyes, 21.6%), thermal burn (5 eyes, 13.5%), unexplained corneal opacity (2 eyes, 5.4%), and corneal perforation (1 eye, 2.7%). Two patients withdrew from the clinical trial at 3 months postoperatively. Thirty-five patients were followed up for 6 months, and 31 were followed up for 12 months. The VA was >/=0.05 in 83.8% of eyes at 6 months and in 81.8% of eyes at 12 months. Among the 11 eyes diagnosed with concurrent glaucoma, 6 eyes achieved a VA of >/=0.05. At 12 months, the c-bKPro retention rate was 100%. The surgical complications included retroprosthetic membrane formation (5 eyes, 16.1%), persistent corneal epithelial defects (5 eyes, 16.1%), macular edema (4 eyes, 12.9%), new-onset glaucoma (4 eyes, 12.5%; including one eye withdrawn from the study at 3 months), sterile corneal melting (2 eyes, 6.5%), sterile vitritis (1 eye, 3.2%), and infectious keratitis (1 eye, 3.2%). Conclusions: C-bKPro implantation is an effective and safe option for treating corneal blindness in high-risk transplantation in China. Improved visual outcomes could be achieved in most cases, with a relatively low incidence of postoperative complications."
[Chinese expert consensus on meibomian gland dysfunction: definition and classification (2023)].,[Zhonghua yan ke za zhi] Chinese journal of ophthalmology,2023 Apr 11,37012588,"Meibomian gland dysfunction (MGD) is a common clinical ocular surface disease. In recent years, great progress has been made in basic and clinical research on MGD, and new diagnostic and therapeutic methods have been continuously applied to clinical practice. To improve the understanding of MGD among Chinese ophthalmologists and standardize the diagnosis and treatment of MGD, the Chinese Branch of the Asia Dry Eye Society and relevant academic groups organized experts to discuss the definition and classification of MGD based on recent research progress and clinical experience at home and abroad, forming consensus opinions for the reference of clinicians."
[Chinese expert consensus on the diagnosis and treatment of drug-induced keratopathy (2023)].,[Zhonghua yan ke za zhi] Chinese journal of ophthalmology,2023 Apr 11,37012587,"Drug-induced keratopathy occurs when the use of certain drugs, particularly ophthalmic preparations, causes pathological changes in the cornea. These changes can be related to the toxic effects of the drugs themselves or drug preservatives. The disease is characterized by a range of clinical features and lacks specific diagnostic criteria, which can lead to misdiagnosis and inappropriate treatment. In order to address these challenges, the Cornea Group of the Ophthalmology Branch of the Chinese Medical Association has brought together leading experts in the field to review key techniques for the diagnosis and treatment of drug-induced keratopathy. As a result, they have developed this consensus to guide the prevention and treatment of this condition."
[Challenges and countermeasures in the development of artificial intelligence research in ophthalmology].,[Zhonghua yan ke za zhi] Chinese journal of ophthalmology,2023 Apr 11,37012586,"The advent of artificial intelligence (AI) technology has led to revolutionary advancements in the diagnosis and treatment of ophthalmic diseases, introducing a novel AI-assisted diagnostic approach for ophthalmology that is rich in imaging diagnostic technologies. However, as clinical applications continue to evolve, AI research in ophthalmology faces challenges such as the lack of standardized datasets and innovative algorithm models, insufficient cross-modal information fusion, and limited clinical interpretability. In response to the growing demand for AI research in ophthalmology, it is essential to establish ophthalmic data standards and sharing platforms, innovate core algorithms, and develop clinical logic interpretable models for the screening, diagnosis, and prediction of eye diseases. Additionally, the deep integration of cutting-edge technologies such as 5G, virtual reality, and surgical robots would advance the development of ophthalmic intelligent medicine into a new phase."
Ectopic expression of a mechanosensitive channel confers spatiotemporal resolution to ultrasound stimulations of neurons for visual restoration.,Nature nanotechnology,2023 Apr 3,37012508,"Remote and precisely controlled activation of the brain is a fundamental challenge in the development of brain-machine interfaces for neurological treatments. Low-frequency ultrasound stimulation can be used to modulate neuronal activity deep in the brain, especially after expressing ultrasound-sensitive proteins. But so far, no study has described an ultrasound-mediated activation strategy whose spatiotemporal resolution and acoustic intensity are compatible with the mandatory needs of brain-machine interfaces, particularly for visual restoration. Here we combined the expression of large-conductance mechanosensitive ion channels with uncustomary high-frequency ultrasonic stimulation to activate retinal or cortical neurons over millisecond durations at a spatiotemporal resolution and acoustic energy deposit compatible with vision restoration. The in vivo sonogenetic activation of the visual cortex generated a behaviour associated with light perception. Our findings demonstrate that sonogenetics can deliver millisecond pattern presentations via an approach less invasive than current brain-machine interfaces for visual restoration."
Diabetic retinopathy progression in patients under monitoring for treatment or vision loss: external validation and update of a multivariable prediction model.,BMJ open,2023 Apr 3,37012014,"INTRODUCTION: The number of people with diabetes mellitus is increasing globally and consequently so too is diabetic retinopathy (DR). Most patients with diabetes are monitored through the diabetic eye screening programme (DESP) until they have signs of retinopathy and these changes progress, requiring referral into hospital eye services (HES). Here, they continue to be monitored until they require treatment. Due to current pressures on HES, delays can occur, leading to harm. There is a need to triage patients based on their individual risk. At present, patients are stratified according to retinopathy stage alone, yet other risk factors like glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) may be useful. Therefore, a prediction model that combines multiple prognostic factors to predict progression will be useful for triage in this setting to improve care.We previously developed a Diabetic Retinopathy Progression model to Treatment or Vision Loss (DRPTVL-UK) using a large primary care database. The aim of the present study is to externally validate the DRPTVL-UK model in a secondary care setting, specifically in a population under care by HES. This study will also provide an opportunity to update the model by considering additional predictors not previously available. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: We will use a retrospective cohort of 2400 patients with diabetes aged 12 years and over, referred from DESP to the NHS hospital trusts with referable DR between 2013 and 2016, with follow-up information recorded until December 2021.We will evaluate the external validity of the DRPTVL-UK model using measures of discrimination, calibration and net benefit. In addition, consensus meetings will be held to agree on acceptable risk thresholds for triage within the HES system. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This study was approved by REC (ref 22/SC/0425, 05/12/2022, Hampshire A Research Ethics Committee). The results of the study will be published in a peer-reviewed journal, presented at clinical conferences. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: ISRCTN 10956293."
Risk factors for recurrences and visual impairment in patients with ocular toxoplasmosis: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,PloS one,2023,37011101,"BACKGROUND: Ocular toxoplasmosis (OT) is caused by the parasite Toxoplasma gondii. OT is the leading cause of posterior uveitis globally; it is a recurrent disease that may result in visual impairment and blindness. This systematic review and meta-analysis aim to summarize and evaluate the risk factors for recurrences, visual impairment, and blindness described in the literature worldwide. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We performed a systematic literature search in PubMed, Embase, VHL, Cochrane Library, Scopus, and DANS EASY Archive. All studies reporting patients with clinically and serologically confirmed OT presenting any clinical or paraclinical factor influencing recurrences, visual impairment, and blindness were included. Studies presenting secondary data, case reports, and case series were excluded. An initial selection was made by title and abstract, and then the studies were reviewed by full text where the eligible studies were selected. Then, the risk of bias was assessed through validated tools. Data were extracted using a validated extraction format. Qualitative synthesis and quantitative analysis were done. This study was registered on PROSPERO (CRD42022327836). RESULTS: Seventy two studies met the inclusion criteria. Fifty-three were summarized in the qualitative synthesis in three sections: clinical and environmental factors, parasite and host factors, and treatment-related factors. Of the 72 articles, 39 were included in the meta-analysis, of which 14 were conducted in South America, 13 in Europe, four in Asia, three multinational, two in North America and Central America, respectively, and only one in Africa. A total of 4,200 patients with OT were analyzed, mean age ranged from 7.3 to 65.1 year of age, with similar distribution by sex. The frequency of recurrences in patients with OT was 49% (95% CI 40%-58%), being more frequent in the South American population than in Europeans. Additionally, visual impairment was presented in 35% (95% CI 25%-48%) and blindness in 20% (95% CI 13%-30%) of eyes, with a similar predominance in South Americans than in Europeans. On the other hand, having lesions near the macula or adjacent to the optic nerve had an OR of 4.83 (95% CI; 2.72-8.59) for blindness, similar to having more than one recurrence that had an OR of 3.18 (95% CI; 1.59-6.38). Finally, the prophylactic therapy with Trimethoprim/Sulfamethoxazole versus the placebo showed a protective factor of 83% during the first year and 87% in the second year after treatment. CONCLUSION: Our Systematic Review showed that clinical factors such as being older than 40 years, patients with de novo OT lesions or with less than one year after the first episode, macular area involvement, lesions greater than 1 disc diameter, congenital toxoplasmosis, and bilateral compromise had more risk of recurrences. Also, environmental and parasite factors such as precipitations, geographical region where the infection is acquired, and more virulent strains confer greater risk of recurrences. Therefore, patients with the above mentioned clinical, environmental, and parasite factors could benefit from using prophylactic therapy."
BDNF signaling in correlation-dependent structural plasticity in the developing visual system.,PLoS biology,2023 Apr 3,37011100,"During development, patterned neural activity instructs topographic map refinement. Axons with similar patterns of neural activity converge onto target neurons and stabilize their synapses with these postsynaptic partners, restricting exploratory branch elaboration (Hebbian structural plasticity). On the other hand, non-correlated firing in inputs leads to synapse weakening and increased exploratory growth of axons (Stentian structural plasticity). We used visual stimulation to control the correlation structure of neural activity in a few ipsilaterally projecting (ipsi) retinal ganglion cell (RGC) axons with respect to the majority contralateral eye inputs in the optic tectum of albino Xenopus laevis tadpoles. Multiphoton live imaging of ipsi axons, combined with specific targeted disruptions of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) signaling, revealed that both presynaptic p75NTR and TrkB are required for Stentian axonal branch addition, whereas presumptive postsynaptic BDNF signaling is necessary for Hebbian axon stabilization. Additionally, we found that BDNF signaling mediates local suppression of branch elimination in response to correlated firing of inputs. Daily in vivo imaging of contralateral RGC axons demonstrated that p75NTR knockdown reduces axon branch elongation and arbor spanning field volume."
Anti-vascular endothelial growth factor for neovascular glaucoma.,The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,2023 Apr 3,37010901,"BACKGROUND: Neovascular glaucoma (NVG) is a potentially blinding, secondary glaucoma. It is caused by the formation of abnormal new blood vessels, which prevent normal drainage of aqueous from the anterior segment of the eye. Anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) medications are specific inhibitors of the primary mediators of neovascularization. Studies have reported the effectiveness of anti-VEGF medications for the control of intraocular pressure (IOP) in NVG. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effectiveness of intraocular anti-VEGF medications, alone or with one or more types of conventional therapy, compared with no anti-VEGF medications for the treatment of NVG. SEARCH METHODS: We searched CENTRAL (which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Trials Register); MEDLINE; Embase; PubMed; and LILACS to 19 October 2021; metaRegister of Controlled Trials to 19 October 2021; and two additional trial registers to 19 October 2021. We did not use any date or language restrictions in the electronic search for trials. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of people treated with anti-VEGF medications for NVG. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently assessed the search results for trials, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias, and the certainty of the evidence. We resolved discrepancies through discussion. MAIN RESULTS: We included five RCTs (356 eyes of 353 participants). Each trial was conducted in a different country: two in China, and one each in Brazil, Egypt, and Japan. All five RCTs included both men and women; the mean age of participants was 55 years or older. Two RCTs compared intravitreal bevacizumab combined with Ahmed valve implantation and panretinal photocoagulation (PRP) with Ahmed valve implantation and PRP alone. One RCT randomized participants to receive an injection of either intravitreal aflibercept or placebo at the first visit, followed by non-randomized treatment according to clinical findings after one week. The remaining two RCTs randomized participants to PRP with and without ranibizumab, one of which had insufficient details for further analysis. We assessed the RCTs to have an unclear risk of bias for most domains due to insufficient information to permit judgment.   Four RCTs examined achieving control of IOP, three of which reported our time points of interest. Only one RCT reported our critical time point at one month; it found that the anti-VEGF group had a 1.3-fold higher chance of achieving control of IOP at one month (RR 1.32, 95% 1.10 to 1.59; 93 participants) than the non-anti-VEGF group (low certainty of evidence). For other time points, one RCT found a three-fold greater achievement in control of IOP in the anti-VEGF group when compared with the non-anti-VEGF group at one year (RR 3.00; 95% CI:1.35 to 6.68; 40 participants). However, another RCT found an inconclusive result at the time period ranging from 1.5 years to three years (RR 1.08; 95% CI: 0.67 to 1.75; 40 participants).  All five RCTs examined mean IOP, but at different time points. Very-low-certainty evidence showed that anti-VEGFs were effective in reducing mean IOP by 6.37 mmHg (95% CI: -10.09 to -2.65; 3 RCTs; 173 participants) at four to six weeks when compared with no anti-VEGFs.  Anti-VEGFs may reduce mean IOP at three months (MD -4.25; 95% CI -12.05 to 3.54; 2 studies; 75 participants), six months (MD -5.93; 95% CI -18.13 to 6.26; 2 studies; 75 participants), one year (MD -5.36; 95% CI -18.50 to 7.77; 2 studies; 75 participants), and more than one year (MD -7.05; 95% CI -16.61 to 2.51; 2 studies; 75 participants) when compared with no anti-VEGFs, but such effects remain uncertain. Two RCTs reported the proportion of participants who achieved an improvement in visual acuity with specified time points. Participants receiving anti-VEGFs had a 2.6 times (95% CI 1.60 to 4.08; 1 study; 93 participants) higher chance of improving visual acuity when compared with those not receiving anti-VEGFs at one month (very low certainty of evidence). Likewise, another RCT found a similar result at 18 months (RR 4.00, 95% CI 1.33 to 12.05; 1 study; 40 participants).  Two RCTs reported the outcome, complete regression of new iris vessels, at our time points of interest. Low-certainty evidence showed that anti-VEGFs had a nearly three times higher chance of complete regression of new iris vessels when compared with no anti-VEGFs (RR 2.63, 95% CI 1.65 to 4.18; 1 study; 93 participants). A similar finding was observed at more than one year in another RCT (RR 3.20, 95% CI 1.45 to 7.05; 1 study; 40 participants).  Regarding adverse events, there was no evidence that the risks of hypotony and tractional retinal detachment were different between the two groups (RR 0.67; 95% CI: 0.12 to 3.57 and RR 0.33; 95% CI: 0.01 to 7.72, respectively; 1 study; 40 participants). No RCTs reported incidents of endophthalmitis, vitreous hemorrhage, no light perception, and serious adverse events. Evidence for the adverse events of anti-VEGFs was low due to limitations in the study design due to insufficient information to permit judgments and imprecision of results due to the small sample size. No trial reported the proportion of participants with relief of pain and resolution of redness at any time point. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Anti-VEGFs as an adjunct to conventional treatment could help reduce IOP in NVG in the short term (four to six weeks), but there is no evidence that this is likely in the longer term. Currently available evidence regarding the short- and long-term effectiveness and safety of anti-VEGFs in achieving control of IOP, visual acuity, and complete regression of new iris vessels in NVG is insufficient. More research is needed to investigate the effect of these medications compared with, or in addition to, conventional surgical or medical treatment in achieving these outcomes in NVG."
An update in the applications of exosomes in cancer theranostics: from research to clinical trials.,Journal of cancer research and clinical oncology,2023 Apr 3,37010586,"Exosomes are nanosized extracellular vesicles secreted by nearly all viable cells following the fusing of multivesicular bodies and the plasma membrane and discharged into the encircling bodily fluids. Exosomes can transport cell-specific components from the source cell to the target cell. Given the enormous potential of exosomes as non-invasive diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic nanovehicles. Lately, accumulated evidence has demonstrated that exosomes serve an important role in prognosis, diagnosis, and even treatment strategies. While several reviews have collective information on the biomedical application of exosomes, a comprehensive review incorporating updated and improved methodologies for beneficial applications of such vesicles in cancer theranostics is indispensable. In the current review, we first provided a comprehensive review of the introduction of exosomes, featuring their discovery, separation, characterization, function, biogenesis, secretion. The implications of exosomes as promising nanovehicles for drug and gene delivery, application of exosome inhibitors in the management of cancers, completed and ongoing clinical trials on the biological relevance of exosomes are then discussed in detail. As the field of exosome research grows, a better understanding of the subcellular parts and mechanisms involved in exosome secretion and targeting of specific cells will help figure out what their exact physiological functions are in the body."
Correlation Between Lens Density Measured by Swept-Source Optical Coherence Tomography and Phacodynamic Parameters of Centurion Phacoemulsification.,Current eye research,2023 Apr 3,37009774,"PURPOSE: To evaluate the correlation between lens density measured by IOL-Master 700 based on swept-source optical coherence tomography (SS-OCT) technology and the phacodynamic parameters of Centurion phacoemulsification in cataract surgery. METHODS: This prospective study included 66 patients (83 eyes) with age-related cataracts. Using the Lens Opacities Classification System III (LOCS III), the lens nuclear color (NC), lens nuclear opalescence (NO), cortical (C), and posterior subcapsular (P) opacities were obtained. Six meridian orientations of IOL-Master 700 images were captured, and the lens and nuclear regions were analyzed using ImageJ to generate the average lens nucleus density (AND) and average lens density (ALD). Phacodynamic parameters were recorded. The correlation between lens density and the phacodynamic parameters was analyzed. According to the AND, patients were divided into four groups (soft, medium-hard, hard, and extremely hard nucleus), and the phacodynamic parameters were compared among groups. RESULTS: The correlation between the AND obtained by LOCS III grading and SS-OCT-based cataract quantification system score (NC and NO) was statistically significant (r(NC) = 0.795, r(NO)=0.794, both p = .000). AND correlated significantly with cumulative dissipated energy (CDE, r = 0.545, p = .000), total ultrasound time (TUST, r = 0.354, p = .001), and total torsional ultrasound time (TTUT, r = 0.314, p = .004). Among the four groups divided by AND, the difference in CDE (P(13) = 0.002, P(14) < 0.001, P(24) = 0.002) was statistically significant. CONCLUSION: AND measured by IOL-Master 700, SS-OCT correlated significantly with LOCS III classification and phacodynamic parameters of the Centurion system, especially with CDE, TUST, and TTUT. AND can be used as an indicator for quantitative evaluation and help inform the surgical plan."
Clinical Practice Update: Management of Infectious Endophthalmitis After Intravitreal Anti-VEGF Injection.,Journal of vitreoretinal diseases,2022 Nov-Dec,37009541,"Although infectious endophthalmitis after intravitreal antivascular endothelial growth factor injections is rare, it is the most feared and potentially devastating complication of this procedure. There is no high-level evidence to provide definitive guidance on the management of endophthalmitis occurring after intravitreal injection (IVI). This clinical practice update reviews the published literature regarding post-IVI endophthalmitis and highlights areas in which further research is needed to better guide its management."
Management and Complications of Dexamethasone Intravitreal Implant Migration Into the Anterior Chamber.,Journal of vitreoretinal diseases,2022 Nov-Dec,37009539,"PURPOSE: To report patient demographics, the clinical course, and visual outcomes across a case series of patients who experienced dexamethasone (DEX) intravitreal implant (Ozurdex, Allergan, Inc) migration into the anterior chamber (AC), with a focus on the corneal transplantation rate. METHODS: In this retrospective cross-sectional study, a chart review of all cases was performed. For numerical responses, means and SDs were calculated. Percentages and absolute numbers were used to report the proportion of patients who experienced various outcomes of interest. RESULTS: The study comprised 32 cases. All cases occurred in pseudophakic eyes; of those, 8 (25.0%) had posterior chamber intraocular lenses in the capsular bag with no known capsular or zonular issues. The mean duration from DEX implant injection to detection of migration was 19.4 +/- 14.5 days. The DEX implant was explanted in 21 patients (65.6%) and repositioned in the vitreous cavity or subconjunctival space in 6 patients (18.8%). Twelve patients (37.5%) ultimately required corneal transplantation. CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this is the largest case series of DEX intravitreal implant migration into the AC compiled to date. Cases of migration occurred in individuals with no known history of significant prior zonule disruption. This potential complication should be discussed with all patients undergoing DEX implant injection, which may aid in earlier presentation and improved visual outcomes."
Posterior Polar Hemispheric Choroidal Dystrophy: Case Report and Presentation of Genetic Screening.,Journal of vitreoretinal diseases,2022 Nov-Dec,37009538,"PURPOSE: Posterior polar hemispheric choroidal dystrophy is a rare dystrophy affecting the choroid and retina with a characteristic clinical appearance that distinguishes it from a broad variety of other retinal diseases. The disease process has a morphology described in the literature that preferentially affects the outer macula and spares the fovea with no arteriolar attenuation or optic nerve pallor. METHODS: This case report illustrates the use of multimodal retinal imaging, visual field testing, electroretinogram, and genetic testing of a patient who we believe fits the clinical pattern established by previous studies describing this condition. RESULTS: Fundus imaging in addition to further imaging modalities such as fluorescein angiography helped further characterize this disease process and aided in the diagnosis. In addition, genetic testing revealed unique allele variants found in this patient. CONCLUSIONS: By taking a multifaceted approach to the diagnosis of retinal pathology, clinicians can make informed decisions regarding patient care."
Paradoxical Exudative Retinopathy and Macular Star Formation After Treatment Initiation in Coats Disease.,Journal of vitreoretinal diseases,2022 Nov-Dec,37009530,"Purpose: This work describes a unique clinical feature in Coats disease. Methods: A retrospective series of 2 cases is reported. Results: Two pediatric patients receiving treatment for Coats disease were included. In both cases, vision worsened secondary to paradoxically increased exudation and macular star formation following standard treatment with intravitreal bevacizumab, sub-Tenon triamcinolone acetonide, and laser photocoagulation. After serial treatments under general anesthesia, the exudates in both cases consolidated. Conclusions: A paradoxical exudative retinopathy can occur in some patients when initiating standard treatment of Coats disease. Longitudinal follow-up with continued intravitreal antivascular endothelial growth factor agents, laser photocoagulation, and corticosteroids might help control persistent exudation in these cases."
Case report: Prader-Willi syndrome and inflammatory arthritis-An important consideration.,Frontiers in pediatrics,2023,37009284,"BACKGROUND: Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is a multisystemic genetically determined disorder. Musculoskeletal manifestations are common in most patients. We report the cases of two children with PWS who developed inflammatory arthritis, complicated with chronic anterior bilateral uveitis in one case. To our knowledge, no previous reports of such an association exist. CASE PRESENTATION: Case 1 was of a 3-year-old girl diagnosed with PWS who developed arthritis of the right knee with morning stiffness, joint swelling, and limited range of motion. Other causes of arthritis were ruled out. Increased inflammatory markers, antinuclear antibody (ANA) positivity, and hypertrophic synovitis on ultrasound confirmed the diagnosis of inflammatory arthritis compatible with juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA). Despite the treatment with methotrexate, arthritis progressed, and etanercept was added. The patient reached and maintained articular remission while on combined MTX and etanercept treatment during 9 years of follow-up. Case 2 was of a 6-year-old boy diagnosed with PWS who developed arthritis of the right knee. Laboratory investigations showed mildly increased acute phase reactants, microcytic anemia, and ANA positivity at high titer (titer 1:1,280). Infectious and other causes of arthritis were excluded. Ultrasound confirmed the presence of joint effusion and synovial thickening, and synovial fluid analysis was consistent with inflammatory arthrosynovitis (white blood cell count of 14,200/microl) compatible with JIA. Shortly after the diagnosis, the ophthalmologic evaluation revealed the presence of bilateral anterior uveitis. Despite MTX and topical corticosteroid, ocular inflammation persisted and adalimumab was added. At the last follow-up, 9 months later, the child experienced inactivity of arthritis and uveitis with normal growth. CONCLUSIONS: We aim to raise awareness of this possible association among pediatricians since arthritis might be underestimated due to high pain tolerance, behavioral disturbances, and other musculoskeletal abnormalities in PWS patients."
Optical Coherence Tomography Angiography: Clinical Utility and Future Directions.,Journal of vitreoretinal diseases,2022 May-Jun,37008547,"PURPOSE: This work aims to review the principles of optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA), to survey its clinical utility, and to highlight the strengths of this technology as well as barriers to adoption. METHODS: A literature review with editorial discussion of the current applications for OCTA is presented. RESULTS: There have been recent advances in multiple domains in OCTA imaging, including devices, algorithms, and new observations pertaining to a range of pathologies. New devices have improved the scanning speed, signal-to-noise ratio, and spatial resolution and offer an increased field of view. New algorithms have been proposed to optimize image processing and reduce artifacts. Numerous studies employing OCTA have been published describing changes to the microvasculature in diabetic retinopathy, age-related macular degeneration, central serous chorioretinopathy, retinal vein occlusion, and uveitis. CONCLUSIONS: OCTA provides noninvasive, high-resolution volumetric scans of the retinal and choroidal vasculature. OCTA can provide valuable data to augment traditional dye-based angiography in a range of chorioretinal diseases."
Intravitreal Nesvacumab (Anti-Angiopoietin-2) Plus Aflibercept in Neovascular AMD: Phase 2 ONYX Randomized Trial.,Journal of vitreoretinal diseases,2023 Jan-Feb,37008402,"PURPOSE: To compare intravitreal nesvacumab (anti-angiopoietin-2) + aflibercept vs intravitreal aflibercept injection (IAI) in neovascular age-related macular degeneration (nAMD). METHODS: Eyes were randomized (1:2:3) to nesvacumab 3 mg + aflibercept 2 mg (LD combo), nesvacumab 6 mg + aflibercept 2 mg (HD combo), or IAI 2 mg at baseline, week 4, and week 8. The LD combo was continued every 8 weeks (q8w). At week 12, the HD combo was re-randomized to q8w or every 12 weeks (q12w) and IAI was re-randomized to q8w, q12w, or HD combo q8w through week 32. RESULTS: The study comprised 365 eyes. At week 12, the mean best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) gains from baseline were similar in the LD combo group, HD combo group, and IAI group (5.2 letters, 5.6 letters, and 5.4 letters, respectively); the mean central subfield thickness (CST) reductions were similar (182.2 microm, 200.0 microm, and 178.6 microm, respectively). The mean changes in BCVA and CST through week 36 were similar across groups. At week 12, complete retinal fluid resolution was observed in 49.1% (LD combo), 50.8% (HD combo), and 43.6% (IAI) of eyes; the proportions with a CST of 300 mum or less were similar across groups. Numerical trends at week 32 toward complete retinal fluid resolution with combination treatment were not maintained at week 36. Serious ocular adverse events were infrequent and comparable across groups. CONCLUSIONS: In nAMD, nesvacumab + aflibercept showed no additional BCVA or CST benefit over IAI monotherapy."
Clinical Outcomes of Combined Phacoemulsification With Intraocular Lens Placement and Microincision Vitrectomy in Adult Vitreoretinal Disease.,Journal of vitreoretinal diseases,2023 Jan-Feb,37008401,"PURPOSE: To evaluate the safety and clinical outcomes of combined phacoemulsification with intraocular lens (IOL) placement and microincision vitrectomy surgery (MIVS) in adult patients with concomitant cataract and vitreoretinal disease. METHODS: A consecutive series of patients with comorbid vitreoretinal disease and cataract who had combined phacoemulsification with IOL placement and MIVS was retrospectively analyzed. The main outcome measures were visual acuity (VA) and intraoperative and postoperative complications. RESULTS: The analysis comprised 648 eyes of 611 patients. The median follow-up was 26.9 months (range, 12-60 months). The most common vitreoretinal pathology was intraocular tumor (53%). The best-corrected Snellen VA improved from 20/192 at baseline to 20/46 at the 12-month follow-up. The most frequent intraoperative complication was capsule tear (3.9%). The most common postoperative adverse events after 3 months of follow-up (mean, 24 months) were vitreous hemorrhage (3.2%) and retinal detachment (1.8%). No patient developed endophthalmitis. CONCLUSIONS: Combined phacoemulsification with IOL placement and MIVS is a safe, effective technique to manage a broad range of vitreoretinal diseases in patients with significant cataract."
Upregulation of C-X-C motif chemokine 12 in the spinal cord alleviated the symptoms of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis in Lewis rats.,Frontiers in neuroscience,2023,37008218,"BACKGROUND: C-X-C motif chemokine 12 (CXCL12) is a chemokine that performs many functions. Studies have shown that CXCL12 can aggravate inflammatory symptoms in the central nervous system (CNS). Evidence also indicates that CXCL12 can promote the repair of myelin sheaths in the CNS in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). Here, we investigated the function of CXCL12 in CNS inflammation by upregulating CXCL12 in the spinal cord and subsequently inducing EAE. MATERIALS AND METHODS: CXCL12 upregulation in the spinal cords of Lewis rats was induced by the injection of adeno-associated virus 9 (AAV9)/eGFP-P2A-CXCL12 after intrathecal catheter implantation. Twenty-one days after AAV injection, EAE was induced and clinical score was collected; Immunofluorescence staining, WB and LFB-PAS staining were used to evaluate the effect of CXCL12 upregulation. In the in vitro study, oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) were harvested, cultured with CXCL12 and AMD3100, and subjected to immunofluorescence staining for functional assessment. RESULTS: CXCL12 was upregulated in the lumbar enlargement of the spinal cord by AAV injection. In each stage of EAE, upregulation of CXCL12 significantly alleviated clinical scores by inhibiting leukocyte infiltration and promoting remyelination. In contrast, the addition of AMD3100, which is a CXCR4 antagonist, inhibited the effect of CXCL12. In vitro, 10 ng/ml CXCL12 promoted the differentiation of OPCs into oligodendrocytes. CONCLUSION: AAV-mediated upregulation of CXCL12 in the CNS can alleviate the clinical signs and symptoms of EAE and significantly decrease the infiltration of leukocytes in the peak stage of EAE. CXCL12 can promote the maturation and differentiation of OPCs into oligodendrocytes in vitro. These data indicate that CXCL12 effectively promotes remyelination in the spinal cord and decreases the signs and symptoms of EAE."
Correlation of Change in Macular Thickness With Change in Visual Acuity in Diabetic Macular Edema: Post Hoc Analysis of VISTA and VIVID Trials.,Journal of vitreoretinal diseases,2022 Jul-Aug,37007927,"Purpose: To assess the correlation between the change in central subfield thickness (CST) and change in best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) in eyes with diabetic macular edema (DME) treated with fixed-dosing intravitreal aflibercept injection (IAI). Methods: This post hoc analysis of the VISTA and VIVID randomized controlled clinical trials, in which 862 eyes with central-involved DME were randomly assigned to IAI 2 mg every 4 weeks (2q4; 290 eyes), IAI 2 mg every 8 weeks after 5 initial monthly doses (2q8; 286 eyes), or macular laser (286 eyes) and followed through 100 weeks. Correlations between the change in CST and change in BCVA from baseline to weeks 12, 52, and 100 were assessed using the Pearson correlation. Results: The respective correlations (r [95% CI]) at weeks 12, 52, and 100 were -0.39 (-0.49 to -0.29), -0.27 (-0.38 to -0.15), and -0.30 (-0.41 to -0.17) in the 2q4 arm and -0.28 (-0.39 to -0.17), -0.29 (-0.41 to -0.17), and -0.33 (-0.44 to -0.20) in the 2q8 arm. Linear regression analysis of the correlation at week 100, adjusted for relevant baseline factors, showed CST changes accounted for 17% of the variance in BCVA changes; every 100-microm decrease in CST was associated with a 1.2-letter increase in BCVA (P = .001). Conclusions: Correlations between the change in CST and change in BCVA after 2q4 or 2q8 fixed-dosing IAI for DME were modest. Although a change in CST might be important in determining the need for antivascular endothelial growth factor for DME at follow-up, it was not a good surrogate for VA outcomes."
Opportunity Cost of Retinal Detachment Surgery vs Office-Based Patient Care.,Journal of vitreoretinal diseases,2022 Jul-Aug,37007922,"Purpose: This work compares physician reimbursements for retinal detachment (RD) surgery with office-based patient care. Methods: A theoretical model was constructed from the physician's perspective for performing a 90-minute uncomplicated RD surgery with its associated perioperative work in the global period (Current Procedural Terminology code 67108) compared with managing 40 patients per 8-hour clinic day in the equivalent time period. The reimbursement rates were based on the 2019 values set by the US Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS). Sensitivity analyses were performed varying the perioperative times, clinical productivity, and postoperative visits. Results: The CMS physician reimbursement rate for 67108 surgery was 17.13 work relative value units (wRVUs); meanwhile, the physician in the reference case could have generated 40.89 wRVUs in the office. CMS reimbursement therefore represented a 58% opportunity cost relative to lost office productivity for the physician. A significant disparity was still present even when modeling 30 patients per day. In sensitivity analyses, clinical productivity exceeded surgical compensation in 99% of modeled scenarios. In threshold analyses, the surgeon in the reference case would have to complete the surgery and all immediate perioperative care within 18 minutes to equal the total CMS valuation. Conclusions: CMS reimbursement for RD surgery resulted in a significant opportunity cost for the physician relative to office-based patient care, which was more pronounced for more efficient clinicians in the office. The sensitivity analyses supported the robustness of the model. Reductions in surgery reimbursements relative to office-based patient care might disincentivize busy clinicians."
Characteristics of eye-related emergency visits and triage differences by nurses and ophthalmologists: Perspective from a single eye center in southern China.,Frontiers in medicine,2023,37007786,"PURPOSE: To describe characteristics of eye-related emergency department (ED) visits and investigate differences in priorities assigned to patients by triage nurses and ophthalmologists. METHODS: A prospective survey was conducted at the ED of Zhongshan Ophthalmic Center from January 1, 2021, to May 31, 2021. Clinical data from patients with acute ophthalmic conditions lasting less than 7 days were collected via a standard questionnaire and the urgency levels assigned by nurses and physicians were also recorded. Binary logistic regression was performed to identify characteristics associated with truly emergency conditions and up- or down-triage. RESULTS: A total of 1907 patients were enrolled, with 582 (30.5%) classified as ""non-emergency."" Red eye (69.7%), eye pain (53.0%), ocular trauma (44.1%), tearing (43.6%), and blurred vision (43.1%) were the most common complaints. Truly emergency tended to be male (OR 2.019, p < 0.001) and with unilateral eye involvement (OR 2.992, p < 0.001). Nurses prioritized conjunctival, scleral, closed ocular trauma and eyelid diseases over doctors while giving less priority to open ocular trauma, cornea, uveitis, and vitreoretinal diseases (p < 0.05). Overemphasis on mild blurred vision (OR 3.718, p = 0.001) and insufficient understanding of conjunctival diseases without red eye (OR 0.254, p = 0.001) were associated with conjunctival disease ""up-triage."" Insufficient awareness of moderate and severe blurred vision was associated with ""down-triage"" for ocular trauma (OR 3.475, p = 0.001 and OR 2.422, p = 0.020, respectively). CONCLUSION: Ophthalmic EDs are typically flooded with patients suffering from acute ocular problems, with a considerable portion for non-emergency conditions. The identification of characteristics associated with truly emergency cases and nurses' triage preferences is valuable in providing target guidance for future ED practice and facilitating the proper allocation of emergency resources."
The impact of the image conversion factor and image centration on retinal vessel geometric characteristics.,Frontiers in medicine,2023,37007779,"BACKGROUND: This study aims to use fundus image material from a long-term retinopathy follow-up study to identify problems created by changing imaging modalities or imaging settings (e.g., image centering, resolution, viewing angle, illumination wavelength). Investigating the relationship of image conversion factor and imaging centering on retinal vessel geometric characteristics (RVGC), offers solutions for longitudinal retinal vessel analysis for data obtained in clinical routine. METHODS: Retinal vessel geometric characteristics were analyzed in scanned fundus photographs with Singapore-I-Vessel-Assessment using a constant image conversion factor (ICF) and an individual ICF, applying them to macula centered (MC) and optic disk centered (ODC) images. The ICF is used to convert pixel measurements into mum for vessel diameter measurements and to establish the size of the measuring zone. Calculating a constant ICF, the width of all analyzed optic disks is included, and it is used for all images of a cohort. An individual ICF, in turn, uses the optic disk diameter of the eye analyzed. To investigate agreement, Bland-Altman mean difference was calculated between ODC images analyzed with individual and constant ICF and between MC and ODC images. RESULTS: With constant ICF (n = 104 eyes of 52 patients) the mean central retinal equivalent was 160.9 +/- 17.08 mum for arteries (CRAE) and 208.7 +/- 14.7.4 mum for veins (CRVE). The individual ICFs resulted in a mean CRAE of 163.3 +/- 15.6 mum and a mean CRVE of 219.0 +/- 22.3 mum. On Bland-Altman analysis, the individual ICF RVGC are more positive, resulting in a positive mean difference for most investigated parameters. Arteriovenous ratio (p = 0.86), simple tortuosity (p = 0.08), and fractal dimension (p = 0.80) agreed well between MC and ODC images, while the vessel diameters were significantly smaller in MC images (p < 0.002). CONCLUSION: Scanned images can be analyzed using vessel assessment software. Investigations of individual ICF versus constant ICF point out the asset of utilizing an individual ICF. Image settings (ODC vs. MC) were shown to have good agreement."
No Strong Association between the Apolipoprotein E E4 Allele and Glaucoma: A Multicohort Study.,Ophthalmology science,2023 Sep,37007646,"PURPOSE: To elucidate a potential association between the apolipoprotein E (APOE) E4 allele and glaucoma prevalence in large cohorts. DESIGN: A cross-sectional analysis of baseline and prospectively collected cohort data. PARTICIPANTS: UK Biobank (UKBB) participants of genetically determined European ancestry (n = 438 711). Replication analyses were performed using clinical and genotyping data collected from European participants recruited to the Canadian Longitudinal Study of Aging (CLSA; n = 18 199), the Australian and New Zealand Registry of Advanced Glaucoma (ANZRAG; n = 1970), and the Blue Mountains Eye Study (BMES; n = 2440). METHODS: Apolipoprotein E alleles and genotypes were determined, and their distributions were compared on the basis of glaucoma status. Similar analyses were performed using positive control outcomes associated with the APOE E4 allele (death, dementia, age-related macular degeneration) and negative control outcomes not associated with the APOE E4 allele (cataract, diabetic eye disease). Outcome phenotypes were also correlated with Alzheimer's dementia (AD), a clinical outcome highly associated with the APOE E4 allele. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Results of APOE E4 genotype-phenotype comparisons were reported as odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Replication analyses investigated APOE E4 associations in 2 replication cohorts (CLSA and ANZRAG/BMES). RESULTS: The APOE E4 allele was inversely associated with glaucoma (OR, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.93-0.99; P = 0.016) and both negative controls (cataract: OR, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.96-0.99; P = 0.015; diabetic eye disease: OR, 0.92; 95% CI, 0.87-0.97; P = 0.003) in the UKBB cohort. A paradoxical positive association was observed between AD and both glaucoma (OR, 1.30; 95% CI, 1.08-1.54; P < 0.01) and cataract (OR, 1.15; 1.04-1.28; P = 0.018). No association between the APOE E4 allele and glaucoma was observed in either replication cohort (CLSA: OR, 1.03; 95% CI, 0.89-1.19; P = 0.66; ANZRAG/BMES: OR, 0.97; 95% CI, 0.84-1.12; P = 0.65). CONCLUSIONS: A small negative association observed between APOE E4 and glaucoma within the UKBB was not evident in either replication cohort and may represent an artifact of glaucoma underdiagnosis in APOE E4 carriers.

Clinical and multimodal imaging characteristics of eyes with Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada disease: An Egyptian experience.,Oman journal of ophthalmology,2023 Jan-Apr,37007255,"BACKGROUND: Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada (VKH) disease is a vision-threatening inflammatory disorder that is challenging in diagnosis and management. METHODS: Retrospective, record-based analysis of 54 eyes belonging to 27 adult patients that fulfilled the revised diagnostic criteria for VKH between January 2018 and January 2021. Demographic, clinical, and imaging data on presentation and during follow-up visits were collected for each patient. Available imaging studies included B-scan ultrasonography (B-scan US), spectral domain optical coherence tomography (OCT), fundus fluorescein angiography (FFA), and OCT angiography (OCT-A). RESULTS: The female-to-male ratio was 2.38:1. Nineteen patients (70.37%) presented during an initial attack, while eight patients (29.63%) presented during recurrence. The most commonly presenting sign in the posterior segment was exudative retinal detachment (44 eyes, 81.48%). B-scan US was utilized in 4 eyes (7.41%), OCT was utilized in 48 eyes (88.89%) with the most common finding being subretinal fluid (43 eyes, 89.58%), FFA was performed in 39 eyes (72.22%) with the most common finding being punctate hyperfluorescence and late dye pooling (33 eyes, 84.62%), and OCT-A was performed in 30 eyes (55.56%), in which choriocapillaris flow deficit that correlated with disease activity was detectable in 25 eyes (83.33%). Improved visual acuity was noted in 85% of the eyes that were followed up. CONCLUSION: Early diagnosis and treatment of VKH result in favorable visual outcome. Multimodal imaging, with the recent addition of OCT-A, provides complementary data that could serve in diagnosis and monitoring."
Optic neuritis presented as the only manifestation of neurosyphilis.,Oman journal of ophthalmology,2023 Jan-Apr,37007240,"Here, we report a case of syphilis presented with optic neuritis to consider neurosyphilis as one of the differential diagnoses of optic neuritis. A 25-year-old male attended at outpatient department of chittagong eye infirmary and training complex institute with a history of a sudden loss of vision in the left eye for 20 days. On eye examination, the patient had reduced visual acuity on the left eye (6/60), and the left pupil showed a relative afferent pupillary defect and swollen left optic disc. No other abnormalities were found in a routine blood test and magnetic resonance imaging of the brain. Intravenous corticosteroid was administered for 3 days followed by oral corticosteroid. His vision was gradually improving within a month and became 6/9 in the left eye, but after a month, the patient returned with the blurring of vision in the same eye for 3 days. An extensive serum biochemical and serological test and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis was done including syphilis serology and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) serology. Venereal disease research laboratory (VDRL) test and Treponema pallidum hemagglutination assay (TPHA) were found positive with high titer (1:1280) and rapid plasma reagin (RPR) titer of 1:64 in blood. The CSF analysis showed leukocytosis, and VDRL and TPHA were also found positive with high RPR titer. The HIV serology test was negative. The patient was treated with injectable ceftriaxone 2 g intravenously for 14 days and also injectable corticosteroid. His vision was improved within this period. Unilateral optic neuritis due to syphilis without other ocular features is uncommon but should be considered if a patient presents with visual loss and optic disc swelling. Early diagnosis based on clinical suspicion and prompt management is important to prevent visual impairment and subsequent neurological complications."
"Pediatric Rhegmatogenous Retinal Detachments: Etiologies, Clinical Course, and Surgical Outcomes.",Journal of vitreoretinal diseases,2023 Mar-Apr,37006670,"Purpose: To describe the predisposing factors, clinical course, and surgical methods of pediatric rhegmatogenous retinal detachment (RRD) and determine which factors affect anatomic success. Methods: Data of patients 18 years or younger who had surgical repair for RRD from January 1, 2004, to June 31, 2020, with a minimum of 6 months of follow-up were retrospectively analyzed. Results: The study evaluated 101 eyes of 94 patients. Of the eyes, 90% had at least 1 predisposing factor to pediatric RRD, including trauma (46%), myopia (41%), prior intraocular surgery (26%), and congenital anomaly (23%); 81% had macula-off detachments and 34% had proliferative vitreoretinopathy (PVR) grade C or worse at presentation. The presence of PVR grade C or worse (P = .0002), total RRD (P = .014), and vitrectomy alone at first surgery (P = .0093) were associated with worse outcomes. Patients who had scleral buckle (SB) alone at the first surgery had statistically higher rates of anatomic success than those who had vitrectomy alone or combined with SB (P = .0002). After the final surgery, 74% of patients achieved anatomic success. Discussion: The majority of cases in this study were associated with 1 of the 4 risk factors predisposing to pediatric RRD. These patients often present late with macula-off detachments and PVR grade C or worse. The majority of patients achieved anatomic success after surgical repair using SB, vitrectomy, or a combination."
Intravitreal Rituximab-Associated Retinal Occlusive Vasculitis.,Journal of vitreoretinal diseases,2023 Mar-Apr,37006669,"PURPOSE: To describe a 90-year-old patient who was referred to a private retina specialist with gradually worsening vision and floaters in the left eye. METHODS: A retrospective case report is presented. RESULTS: The patient was treated with intravitreal rituximab injections for intraocular lymphoma with resulting vision loss to the level of hand motions from severe granulomatous uveitis and retinal occlusive vasculitis. CONCLUSIONS: Retinal occlusive vasculopathy secondary to rituximab intravitreal injections is a rare clinical entity with only a single previous case reported in the literature. However, there are reports of systemic vasculitis after systemic administration of rituximab. Clinicians should be aware of the possibility of ocular hypertension, granulomatous anterior uveitis, and/or retinal occlusive vasculitis after intravitreal rituximab use. Consideration should be given to the inflammatory risk of rituximab intravitreal injections to reduce the potential for treatment-induced vision loss."
Retinal Vasculopathy With Cerebral Leukoencephalopathy and Systemic Manifestations: Critical Role of Retina Specialists.,Journal of vitreoretinal diseases,2023 Mar-Apr,37006667,"PURPOSE: To describe a case of retinal vasculopathy with cerebral leukoencephalopathy and systemic manifestations (RVCL-S) to enhance early recognition of this often-missed diagnosis. METHODS: A case report is presented. RESULTS: A 50-year-old woman with a history of Raynaud phenomenon, memory difficulties, and a family history of strokes was referred for evaluation of a bilateral, small-vessel, occlusive disease refractory to immunosuppressive therapy. An extensive workup for treatable causes was unrevealing. Fifteen months after presentation, brain imaging showed white-matter lesions and dystrophic calcification, which led to the discovery of a pathogenic variant in TREX1 and the diagnosis of RVCL-S. CONCLUSIONS: Retina specialists play a critical role in the timely diagnosis of RVCL-S. Although the findings in this condition can mimic those in other common retinal vascular disorders, there are key characteristics that increase the suspicion for RVCL-S. Early recognition might decrease unnecessary therapies and procedures."
Telangiectatic Capillaries in Retinal Vascular Occlusions: Multimodal Imaging in a Case Series.,Journal of vitreoretinal diseases,2023 Mar-Apr,37006666,"Introduction: To report a cases series of retinal vascular occlusions with telangiectatic capillaries (TelCaps) seen on indocyanine green angiography (ICGA) and multimodal imaging. Methods: In this case series, a new finding (TelCaps) was seen on clinical examination, fundus evaluation, fluorescein angiography, ICGA, and optical coherence tomography (OCT). Results: This series comprised 3 patients with TelCaps findings on ICGA after retinal vascular occlusions. The patients' ages ranged from 52 years to 71 years and the best-corrected visual acuity in the affected eye, from 20/25 to 20/80. Fundus evaluation showed small, hard exudates in the vascular termination close to the macula with a reduction of the foveal reflex. The OCT images showed marginal hyperreflectivity and inner hyporeflectivity that were suggestive of a TelCaps lesion, which was confirmed by hyperfluorescence in the late phase of ICGA. Conclusions: This study highlights the importance of performing multimodal imaging evaluation, including ICGA, in eyes with retinal vein occlusions for early identification and management of the associated lesions."
Intraocular Methotrexate for the Treatment and Prevention of Proliferative Vitreoretinopathy: A Review.,Journal of vitreoretinal diseases,2023 Mar-Apr,37006665,"PURPOSE: To review the current literature on the use of intravitreal methotrexate (IVT MTX) for the treatment and prevention of proliferative vitreoretinopathy (PVR). METHODS: All reports of IVT MTX to treat and prevent PVR published in PubMed, Google Scholar, and EBSCOhost were reviewed. The relevant current studies are included in this report. RESULTS: The literature search yielded 32 articles describing the use of MTX in PVR. These included preclinical studies, 1 case report, and several case series. Early studies found that IVT MTX is a promising medication for the treatment and prevention of PVR. MTX works as a potent anti-inflammatory agent through a new mechanism of action different from that of other medications for use in PVR. Few side effects have been reported and were mostly limited to mild reversible corneal keratopathy. There are 2 current ongoing randomized controlled clinical trials to further evaluate the efficacy of MTX for PVR. CONCLUSIONS: MTX is a safe and potentially efficacious medication for the treatment and prevention of PVR. Additional clinical trials are needed to further establish this effect."
Sensory impairments and subjective well-being status in middle-aged and older Chinese population: Cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses of a nationally representative survey.,Frontiers in public health,2023,37006552,"PURPOSE: To investigate the impacts of sensory impairments (SIs) including single vision impairment (SVI), single hearing impairment (SHI) and dual sensory impairment (DSI) on subjective wellbeing measurements including life expectancy (LE), life satisfaction (LS) and self-rated health (SRH) in middle-aged and older Chinese population. METHODS: We obtained data from the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Survey (CHARLS). In total, 9,293 Chinese middle-aged and older adults aging over 45 were included at baseline 2011 in this study, and 3,932 participants who accomplished all 4 interviews from 2011 to 2018 were adapted for longitudinal analyses. Sensory status and subjective wellbeing measurements were collected. Other covariates included socio-demographic characteristics, medical condition and lifestyle-related factors. The impacts of baseline sensory status on LE, LS and SRH were assessed using univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses. A linear regression analysis with generalized estimating equations (GEE) was used to assess the association between time-varying sensory statuses with LE, LS and SRH over 8 years after being adjusted with multi-confounding factors. RESULTS: Participants with SIs had significantly lower level of LE, LS, and SRH, compared to those who were free of SI. All kinds of SIs were significantly associated with LE, LS, and SRH according to cross-sectional data. The correlations between SIs and LE or SRH over 8 years were also noticed. However, only SHI and DSI were found to be significantly associated with LS according to longitudinal data (all p values < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Sensory impairments had explicitly detrimental effects on subjective wellbeing status over time among middle-aged and older Chinese population."
"Widespread genomic influences on phenotype in Dravet syndrome, a 'monogenic' condition.",Brain : a journal of neurology,2023 Apr 3,37006128,"Dravet syndrome is an archetypal rare severe epilepsy, considered ""monogenic"", typically caused by loss-of-function SCN1A variants. Despite a recognisable core phenotype, its marked phenotypic heterogeneity is incompletely explained by differences in the causal SCN1A variant or clinical factors. In 34 adults with SCN1A-related Dravet syndrome, we show additional genomic variation beyond SCN1A contributes to phenotype and its diversity, with an excess of rare variants in epilepsy-related genes as a set and examples of blended phenotypes, including one individual with an ultra-rare DEPDC5 variant and focal cortical dysplasia. Polygenic risk scores for intelligence are lower, and for longevity, higher, in Dravet syndrome than in epilepsy controls. The causal, major-effect, SCN1A variant may need to act against a broadly compromised genomic background to generate the full Dravet syndrome phenotype, whilst genomic resilience may help to ameliorate the risk of premature mortality in adult Dravet syndrome survivors."
Facial expression of patients with Graves' orbitopathy.,Journal of endocrinological investigation,2023 Apr 1,37005981,"PURPOSE: Patients with Graves' orbitopathy (GO) have characteristic facial expressions that are different from those of healthy individuals due to the combination of somatic and psychiatric symptoms. However, the facial expressions of GO patients have not yet been described and analyzed systematically. Thus, the present study aimed to present the facial expressions of GO patients and explore their applications in clinical practice. METHODS: Facial image and clinical data of 943 GO patients were included, and 126 patients answered quality of life (GO-QOL) questionnaires. Each patient was labeled for one facial expression. Then, a portrait was drawn for every facial expression. Logistic and linear regression was performed to analyze the correlation between facial expression and clinical indicators, including QOL, disease activity and severity. The VGG-19 network model was utilized to discriminate facial expressions automatically. RESULTS: Two groups, i.e., the non-negative emotion (neutral, happy) and the negative emotion (disgust, angry, fear, sadness, surprise), and seven expressions of GO patients were systematically analyzed. Facial expression was statistically associated with GO activity (P = 0.002), severity (P < 0.001), QOL visual functioning subscale scores (P = 0.001), and QOL appearance subscale score (P = 0.012). The deep learning model achieved satisfactory results (accuracy 0.851, sensitivity 0.899, precision 0.899, specificity 0.720, F1 score 0.899, and AUC 0.847). CONCLUSIONS: As a novel clinical sign, facial expression holds the potential to be incorporated into GO assessment system in the future. The discrimination model may assist clinicians in real-life patient care."
Tumor microenvironment signaling and therapeutics in cancer progression.,"Cancer communications (London, England)",2023 Apr 2,37005490,"Tumor development and metastasis are facilitated by the complex interactions between cancer cells and their microenvironment, which comprises stromal cells and extracellular matrix (ECM) components, among other factors. Stromal cells can adopt new phenotypes to promote tumor cell invasion. A deep understanding of the signaling pathways involved in cell-to-cell and cell-to-ECM interactions is needed to design effective intervention strategies that might interrupt these interactions. In this review, we describe the tumor microenvironment (TME) components and associated therapeutics. We discuss the clinical advances in the prevalent and newly discovered signaling pathways in the TME, the immune checkpoints and immunosuppressive chemokines, and currently used inhibitors targeting these pathways. These include both intrinsic and non-autonomous tumor cell signaling pathways in the TME: protein kinase C (PKC) signaling, Notch, and transforming growth factor (TGF-beta) signaling, Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER) stress response, lactate signaling, Metabolic reprogramming, cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS)-stimulator of interferon genes (STING) and Siglec signaling pathways. We also discuss the recent advances in Programmed Cell Death Protein 1 (PD-1), Cytotoxic T-Lymphocyte Associated Protein 4 (CTLA4), T-cell immunoglobulin mucin-3 (TIM-3) and Lymphocyte Activating Gene 3 (LAG3) immune checkpoint inhibitors along with the C-C chemokine receptor 4 (CCR4)- C-C class chemokines 22 (CCL22)/ and 17 (CCL17), C-C chemokine receptor type 2 (CCR2)- chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 2 (CCL2), C-C chemokine receptor type 5 (CCR5)- chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 3 (CCL3) chemokine signaling axis in the TME. In addition, this review provides a holistic understanding of the TME as we discuss the three-dimensional and microfluidic models of the TME, which are believed to recapitulate the original characteristics of the patient tumor and hence may be used as a platform to study new mechanisms and screen for various anti-cancer therapies. We further discuss the systemic influences of gut microbiota in TME reprogramming and treatment response. Overall, this review provides a comprehensive analysis of the diverse and most critical signaling pathways in the TME, highlighting the associated newest and critical preclinical and clinical studies along with their underlying biology. We highlight the importance of the most recent technologies of microfluidics and lab-on-chip models for TME research and also present an overview of extrinsic factors, such as the inhabitant human microbiome, which have the potential to modulate TME biology and drug responses."
Exploring the components and mechanisms of Shen-qi-wang-mo granule in the treatment of retinal vein occlusion by UPLC-Triple TOF MS/MS and network pharmacology.,Scientific reports,2023 Apr 1,37005436,"This study aimed to explore the substance basis and mechanisms of Shen-qi-wang-mo Granule (SQWMG), a traditional Chinese medicine prescription that had been clinically utilized to treat retinal vein occlusion (RVO) for 38 years. Components in SQWMG were analyzed by UPLC-Triple-TOF/MS and a total of 63 components were identified with ganoderic acids (GA) being the largest proportion. Potential targets of active components were retrieved from SwissTargetPrediction. RVO-related targets were acquired from related disease databases. Core targets of SQWMG against RVO were acquired by overlapping the above targets. The 66 components (including 5 isomers) and 169 targets were obtained and concluded into a component-target network. Together with biological enrichment analysis of targets, it revealed the crucial role of the ""PI3K-Akt signaling pathway"", ""MAPK signaling pathway"" and their downstream factor iNOS and TNF-alpha. The 20 key targets of SQWMG in treating RVO were acquired from the network and pathway analysis. The effects of SQWMG on targets and pathways were validated by molecular docking based on AutoDock Vina and qPCR experiment. The molecular docking showed great affinity for these components and targets, especially on ganoderic acids (GA) and alisols (AS), which were both triterpenoids and qPCR exhibited remarkably reduced inflammatory factor gene expression through regulation of these two pathways. Finally, the key components were also identified from rat serum after treatment of SQWMG."
Metabolomic analysis of aqueous humor reveals potential metabolite biomarkers for differential detection of macular edema.,"Eye and vision (London, England)",2023 Apr 1,37004107,"BACKGROUND: Macular edema (ME) is a major complication of retinal disease with multiple mechanisms involved in its development. This study aimed to investigate the metabolite profile of aqueous humor (AH) in patients with ME of different etiologies and identify potential metabolite biomarkers for early diagnosis of ME. METHODS: Samples of AH were collected from 60 patients with ME and 20 age- and sex-matched controls and analyzed by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC/MS)-based metabolomics. A series of univariate and multivariate statistical analyses were performed to identify differential metabolites and enriched metabolite pathways. RESULTS: The metabolic profile of AH differed significantly between ME patients and healthy controls, and differentially expressed metabolites were identified. Pathway analysis revealed that these differentially expressed metabolites are mainly involved in lipid metabolism and amino acid metabolism. Moreover, significant differences were identified in the metabolic composition of AH from patients with ME due to different retinal diseases including age-related macular degeneration (AMD-ME), diabetic retinopathy (DME) and branch retinal vein occlusion (BRVO-ME). In total, 39 and 79 etiology-specific altered metabolites were identified for AMD-ME and DME, respectively. Finally, an AH-derived machine learning-based diagnostic model was developed and successfully validated in the test cohort with an area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve of 0.79 for AMD-ME, 0.94 for DME and 0.77 for BRVO-ME. CONCLUSIONS: Our study illustrates the potential underlying metabolic basis of AH of different etiologies across ME populations. We also identify AH-derived metabolite biomarkers that may improve the differential diagnosis and treatment stratification of ME patients with different etiologies."
Organ-specific allergen challenges in airway allergy: current utilities and future directions.,Allergy,2023 Apr 1,37002709,"Atopy has been long used as the screening method for airway allergy. Nevertheless, aeroallergens can trigger respiratory symptoms not only in atopic patients (atopic respiratory allergy, ARA), but also in non-atopic subjects (local respiratory allergy, LRA). Moreover, ARA and LRA can coexist in the same patient, and this clinical scenario has been called dual respiratory allergy (DRA). When the clinical history cannot determine the relevance of sensitizations in ARA patients, nasal, conjunctival or bronchial allergen challenges (NAC, CAC and BAC, respectively) should be conducted. Moreover, these tests are required to identify patients with LRA and DRA. The clarification of the allergic triggers of airway diseases has a profound impact on the management strategies the patients can be offered. Importantly, allergen immunotherapy (AIT) remains as the only disease-modifying intervention for ARA. Recent data indicate that AIT might have a similar effect on LRA patients. Nevertheless, AIT success relies largely on the correct phenotyping of allergic individuals, and NAC, CAC and BAC are very helpful tools in this regard. In this review, we will summarize the main indications and methodology of CAC, NAC and BAC. Importantly, the clinical implementation of these tests might translate into precision medicine approaches and better health outcomes for patients with airway allergy."
Building a new regional home for implementation science: Annual Midwest Clinical & Translational Research Meetings.,Journal of investigative medicine : the official publication of the American Federation for Clinical Research,2023 Mar 31,37002618,"The vision of the Central Society for Clinical and Translational Research (CSCTR) is to ""promote a vibrant, supportive community of multidisciplinary, clinical, and translational medical research to benefit humanity.""

Expression of alpha-Synuclein in the mouse retina is confined to inhibitory presynaptic elements.,The Journal of comparative neurology,2023 Mar 31,37002599,"alpha-Synuclein (alpha-Syn) is enriched in presynaptic terminals of the central nervous system including the retina and plays a role in the synaptic vesicle cycle and synaptic transmission. Abnormal aggregation of alpha-Syn is considered to be the main component of the Lewy bodies that are the pathological hallmarks of Parkinson's disease. Although expression pattern of alpha-Syn has been described in the retinas, its precise cellular and subcellular locations are poorly understood. We investigated the precise expression of alpha-Syn using light microscopy (LM) and electron microscopy (EM) with antibodies against alpha-Syn in the mouse retina. We found that the majority of alpha-Syn immunoreactivity (IR) is located in GABAergic, glycinergic, and dopaminergic amacrine cells, and their processes often make a direct synapse to other labeled or unlabeled amacrine profiles, bipolar cell terminals, or ganglion cell dendrites. Further, our LM and immuno-EM results confirm the absence of alpha-Syn in excitatory photoreceptors, bipolar cell bodies, and their ribbon synapses, providing evidence, for the first time, that ribbon synapses do not express alpha-Syn. Additionally, alpha-Syn IR is located in the ganglion cells, some of which are intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells. These results reveal a previously unappreciated inhibitory synapse-specific expression pattern of alpha-Syn in the retina, suggesting that alpha-Syn may play a distinct role in the modulation and integration of inhibitory synaptic transmission in the retina."
Distribution and determinants of choroidal vascularity index in healthy eyes from deep-learning choroidal analysis: a population-based SS-OCT study.,The British journal of ophthalmology,2023 Mar 31,37001972,"AIMS: To quantify the profiles of choroidal vascularity index (CVI) using fully artificial intelligence (AI)-based algorithm applied to swept-source optical coherence tomography (SS-OCT) images and evaluate the determinants of CVI in a population-based study. METHODS: This cross-sectional study included adults aged >/=35 years residing in the Yuexiu District of Guangzhou, China, a follow-up population-based study. All participants (n=646) underwent comprehensive ophthalmic examinations, including SS-OCT for quantifying choroidal parameters. The CVI and subfoveal choroidal thickness (SFCT) were measured by a novel AI-based system. RESULTS: A total of 556 participants were included, with a mean age of 56.4+/-9.9 years and 44.96% women. The average CVI and SFCT of the overall population were 69.7% (95% CI 69.2 to 70.3) and 263.0 microm (95% CI 257.2 to 268.8), respectively. After adjusting for other factors, older age and longer AL were significantly associated with a lower CVI. The CVI decreased by -0.13% (-0.19 to -0.06, p<0.001) with each 1-year increase in age, -2.10% (-3.29 to -0.92, p=0.001) with each 1 mm increase in AL. Furthermore, significantly positive correlation between CVI and SFCT has been observed, with coefficient of 0.059 (0.052 to 0.065, p<0.001). CONCLUSION: Using new AI-based choroidal segmentation software, we provided a fast, reliable and objective CVI profile for large-scale samples. Older age and longer AL were independent correlates of choroidal thinning and CVI decline. These factors should be considered when interpreting SS-OCT-based choroidal measurements."

The impact of non-coding RNAs in the pathobiology of eye disorders.,International journal of biological macromolecules,2023 Mar 29,37001772,"Eye disorders are common disorders with significant effects on personal, economic, and social aspects of life. These disorders have a genetic background and are associated with dysregulation of non-coding RNAs. Three classes of these transcripts, namely long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), circular RNAs (circRNAs) and microRNAs (miRNAs) have established roles in the regulation of gene expression and pathoetiology of ocular disorders. H19, MEG3, BANCR, UCA1, HOTAIR, ANRIL, XIST and MIAT are among important lncRNAs in ocular disorders. CircRNAs from ZBTB44, HIPK3, circ-PSEN1, COL1A2, ZNF532 and FAM158A loci have also been found to affect pathoetiology of ocular disorders. Both lncRNAs and circRNAs can serve as molecular sponges for miRNAs. In this review, we searched PubMed and Google Scholar databases to find the research articles summarizing the impact of non-coding RNAs in ocular disorders. The results of these studies would help in identification of suitable targets for treatment of ocular disorders."
In-depth molecular profiling of an intronic GNAO1 mutant as the basis for personalized high-throughput drug screening.,"Med (New York, N.Y.)",2023 Mar 22,37001522,"BACKGROUND: The GNAO1 gene, encoding the major neuronal G protein Galphao, is mutated in a subset of pediatric encephalopathies. Most such mutations consist of missense variants. METHODS: In this study, we present a precision medicine workflow combining next-generation sequencing (NGS) diagnostics, molecular etiology analysis, and personalized drug discovery. FINDINGS: We describe a patient carrying a de novo intronic mutation (NM_020988.3:c.724-8G>A), leading to epilepsy-negative encephalopathy with motor dysfunction from the second decade. Our data show that this mutation creates a novel splice acceptor site that in turn causes an in-frame insertion of two amino acid residues, Pro-Gln, within the regulatory switch III region of Galphao. This insertion misconfigures the switch III loop and creates novel interactions with the catalytic switch II region, resulting in increased GTP uptake, defective GTP hydrolysis, and aberrant interactions with effector proteins. In contrast, intracellular localization, Gbetagamma interactions, and G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) coupling of the Galphao[insPQ] mutant protein remain unchanged. CONCLUSIONS: This in-depth analysis characterizes the heterozygous c.724-8G>A mutation as partially dominant negative, providing clues to the molecular etiology of this specific pathology. Further, this analysis allows us to establish and validate a high-throughput screening platform aiming at identifying molecules that could correct the aberrant biochemical functions of the mutant Galphao. FUNDING: This work was supported by the Joint Seed Money Funding scheme between the University of Geneva and the Hebrew University of Jerusalem."
Long-Term Clinical Outcomes of Keratolimbal Allograft Alone or in Combination With Keratoplasty in Chronic and Delayed-Onset Mustard Gas Keratopathy.,Cornea,2023 May 1,37000700,"PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to investigate the long-term clinical outcome of keratolimbal allograft (KLAL) alone or in combination with keratoplasty, in the management of patients with chronic and delayed-onset mustard gas keratopathy (MGK). METHODS: Patients who had KLAL for MGK with or without corneal transplantation between 2002 and 2016 were recalled to be enrolled in this retrospective interventional case series. The primary outcome was the success rate of the KLAL demonstrated by Kaplan-Meier cumulative survival analysis. The secondary outcomes were postoperative BCVA and the need for further surgery. RESULTS: A total of 108 eyes of 68 patients with MGK underwent KLAL. All patients were male with an average age of 54 +/- 6 years with an average follow-up duration of 81.9 +/- 38.4 months. Sectoral KLAL alone was performed in 62 eyes (57.4%), combined with lamellar keratoplasty (LKP) in 40 eyes (37%) and combined with penetrating keratoplasty in 6 eyes (5.6%). The cumulative probability of success was 75% within the follow-up duration. The mean duration of successful KLAL survival was 80.6 +/- 38 months. 88.1% of these eyes needed only 1 operation to stabilize the ocular surface. Average BCVA did not improve significantly after KLAL alone, except in those accompanied by keratoplasty. KLAL combined with LKP achieved the superior clinical outcome compared with KLAL alone. Infectious keratitis occurred in 6 eyes (5.5%). No adverse event due to postoperative systemic immunosuppression was observed. CONCLUSIONS: KLAL alone or combined with LKP is effective, durable, and visually acceptable in the reconstruction of ocular surface in patients with limbal stem cell deficiency secondary to MGK."
Potential Protective Function of Adiponectin in Diabetic Retinopathy.,Ophthalmology and therapy,2023 Mar 31,37000404,"Adiponectin, one of the most ubiquitous adipokines found in the blood, plays a major role in glucolipid metabolism and energy metabolism and regulation. In recent years, a growing body of research indicates that adiponectin also plays a significant role in diabetic retinopathy. In the present review, we specifically address the protective effects of adiponectin on the development and progression of diabetic retinopathy through improvement in insulin resistance, alleviation of oxidative stress, limiting of inflammation, and prevention of vascular remodeling, with the aim to explore new potential approaches and targets for the prevention and treatment of diabetic retinopathy."
"Sustained release of tumor cell lysate and CpG from an injectable, cytotoxic hydrogel for melanoma immunotherapy.",Nanoscale advances,2023 Mar 28,36998647,"Many basic research studies have shown the potential of autologous cancer vaccines in the treatment of melanoma. However, some clinical trials showed that simplex whole tumor cell vaccines can only elicit weak CD8(+) T cell-mediated antitumor responses which were not enough for effective tumor elimination. So efficient cancer vaccine delivery strategies with improved immunogenicity are needed. Herein, we described a novel hybrid vaccine ""MCL"" (Melittin-RADA(32)-CpG-Lysate) which was composed of melittin, RADA(32), CpG and tumor lysate. In this hybrid vaccine, antitumor peptide melittin and self-assembling fusion peptide RADA(32) were assembled to form the hydrogel framework melittin-RADA(32)(MR). Then, whole tumor cell lysate and immune adjuvant CpG-ODN were loaded into MR to develop an injectable and cytotoxic hydrogel MCL. MCL showed excellent ability for sustained drug release, to activate dendritic cells and directly kill melanoma cells in vitro. In vivo, MCL not only exerted direct antitumor activity, but also had robust immune initiation effects including the activation of dendritic cells in draining lymph nodes and the infiltration of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) in tumor microenvironment. In addition, MCL can efficiently inhibit melanoma growth in B16-F10 tumor bearing mice, which suggested that MCL is a potential cancer vaccine strategy for melanoma treatment."
Investigating the change in gene expression profile of blood mononuclear cells post-laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy in Chinese obese patients.,Frontiers in endocrinology,2023,36998473,"BACKGROUND: Laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) is a sustainable technique that effectively treats morbid obesity. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the improvement of metabolic health following this process warrants more investigation. This study investigates LSG-related molecules and uses bulk RNA-sequencing high-throughput analysis to unravel their regulatory mechanisms. METHODS: Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were collected from ten obese patients with BMI >/= 32.5 kg/m(2) in the Department of General Surgery of Kunming First People's Hospital. After LSG, patients were followed up for one month, and blood samples were retaken. Blood samples from ten patients before and after LSG and bulk RNA-Seq data were analyzed in this study. LSG-associated gene expression was detected by weighted gene coexpression network analysis (WGCNA) and differential analysis. Subsequently, essential signature genes were identified using logistic least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) and support vector machine-recursive feature elimination (SVM-RFE) algorithms. Gene Ontology (GO), Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG), and single-sample gene set enrichment analysis (ssGSEA) were utilized to reveal the potential functions of the target genes. Furthermore, the Pearson correlation of signature genes with leptin and lipocalin was also explored. Finally, we constructed a robust endogenous RNA (ceRNA) network based on miRWalk and starBase databases. RESULTS: We identified 18 overlapping genes from 91 hub genes, and 165 differentially expressed mRNAs (DE-mRNA), which were revealed to be significantly associated with immune cells, immune response, inflammatory response, lipid storage, and localization upon functional enrichment analysis. Three signature genes, IRF1, NFKBIA, and YRDC, were identified from the 18 overlapping genes by LASSO and SVM-REF algorithms. The logistic regression model based on the three signature genes highlighted how robustly they discriminated between samples. ssGSEA indicated these genes to be involved in lipid metabolism and degradation pathways. Moreover, leptin levels were significantly reduced in patients undergoing LSG, and NFKBIA significantly negatively correlated with leptin. Finally, we identified how the long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) ATP2B1-AS1 regulated the expression of the signature genes by competitively binding to six microRNAs (miRNAs), which were hsa-miR-6509-5p, hsa-miR-330-5P, hsa-miR-154-5P, hsa-miR-145-5P, hsa-miR4726-5P and hsa-miR-134-5P. CONCLUSION: This study identified three critical regulatory genes significantly differentiated between patients before and after LSG treatment and highlighted their potentially crucial role after bariatric surgery. This provides novel insights to increase our understanding of the underlying mechanisms of weight loss and associated metabolic improvement after bariatric surgery."
Image sharpening algorithms improve clarity of surgical field during 3D heads-up surgery.,International journal of retina and vitreous,2023 Mar 30,36998005,"BACKGROUND: Image-sharpening algorithms with color adjustments enable real-time processing of the surgical field with a delay of 4 msec for heads-up surgery using digital three-dimensional displays. The aim of this study was to investigate the usefulness of the algorithms with the Artevo 800((R)) digital microscope. METHODS: Seven vitreoretinal surgeons evaluated the effects of image-sharpening processing on the clarity of the surgical field with the Artevo 800((R)) system that is used for cataract and vitreous surgeries. The scorings were made on a 10-point scale for anterior capsulotomy, phacoemulsification, cortex aspiration, core vitrectomy, and peeling of an epiretinal membrane or an internal limiting membrane. In addition, the images during the internal limiting membrane peeling were processed with or without color adjustments. We also evaluated the skewness (asymmetry in the distribution of the pixels) and kurtosis (sharpness in the distribution of the pixel) of the images to evaluate the contrast with each intensity of image-sharpening. RESULTS: Our results showed that the mean visibility score increased significantly from 4.9 +/- 0.5 at 0% (original image) to 6.6 +/- 0.5 at 25% intensity of the image-sharpening algorithm (P < 0.01). The visibility scores of the internal limiting membrane increased significantly from 0% (6.8 +/- 0.3, no color adjustments) to 50% after the color adjustments (7.4 +/- 0.4, P = 0.012). The mean skewness decreased significantly from 0.83 +/- 2.02 at 0% (original source) to 0.55 +/- 1.36 at 25% intensity of the image-sharpening algorithm (P = 0.01). The mean kurtosis decreased significantly from 0.93 +/- 2.14 at 0% (original image) to 0.60 +/- 1.44 at 25% intensity of the image-sharpening algorithm (P = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that the image-sharpening algorithms can improve the clarity of the surgical field during 3D heads-up surgery by decreasing the skewness and kurtosis. TRIAL REGISTRATION: This was a prospective clinical study performed at a single academic institution, and the procedures used were approved by the Institutional Review Committee of the Kyorin University School of Medicine (reference number, 1904). The procedures also conformed to the tenets of the Declaration of Helsinki."
Release of frustration drives corneal amyloid disaggregation by brain chaperone.,Communications biology,2023 Mar 30,36997596,"TGFBI-related corneal dystrophy (CD) is characterized by the accumulation of insoluble protein deposits in the corneal tissues, eventually leading to progressive corneal opacity. Here we show that ATP-independent amyloid-beta chaperone L-PGDS can effectively disaggregate corneal amyloids in surgically excised human cornea of TGFBI-CD patients and release trapped amyloid hallmark proteins. Since the mechanism of amyloid disassembly by ATP-independent chaperones is unknown, we reconstructed atomic models of the amyloids self-assembled from TGFBIp-derived peptides and their complex with L-PGDS using cryo-EM and NMR. We show that L-PGDS specifically recognizes structurally frustrated regions in the amyloids and releases those frustrations. The released free energy increases the chaperone's binding affinity to amyloids, resulting in local restructuring and breakage of amyloids to protofibrils. Our mechanistic model provides insights into the alternative source of energy utilized by ATP-independent disaggregases and highlights the possibility of using these chaperones as treatment strategies for different types of amyloid-related diseases."
Interferon-alpha2a induces CD4(+) T cell apoptosis and suppresses Th1/Th17 responses via upregulating IRF1-mediated PDL1 expression in dendritic cells from Behcet's uveitis.,"Clinical immunology (Orlando, Fla.)",2023 Mar 29,36997038,"Recombinant interferon-alpha2a (IFNalpha2a) has been widely used in the treatment of Behcet's uveitis (BU). However, the mechanism underlying its effects remains poorly understood. In this study, we investigated its effect on dendritic cells (DCs) and CD4(+) T cells, which are essential for the development of BU. Our results showed that the expression of PDL1 and IRF1 was significantly decreased in DCs from active BU patients, and IFNalpha2a could significantly upregulate PDL1 expression in an IRF1-dependent manner. IFNalpha2a-treated DCs induced CD4(+) T cells apoptosis and inhibited the Th1/Th17 immune response in association with reduced secretion of IFN-gamma and IL-17. We also found that IFNalpha2a promoted Th1 cell differentiation and IL-10 secretion by CD4(+) T cells. Finally, a comparison of patients before and after IFNalpha2a therapy revealed that the frequencies of Th1/Th17 cells significantly decreased in association with remission of uveitis after IFNalpha2a therapy. Collectively, these results show that IFNalpha2a could exert its effects by modulating the function of DCs and CD4(+) T cells in BU."
Bi-allelic variants in the ESAM tight-junction gene cause a neurodevelopmental disorder associated with fetal intracranial hemorrhage.,American journal of human genetics,2023 Mar 26,36996813,"The blood-brain barrier (BBB) is an essential gatekeeper for the central nervous system and incidence of neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) is higher in infants with a history of intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). We discovered a rare disease trait in thirteen individuals, including four fetuses, from eight unrelated families associated with homozygous loss-of-function variant alleles of ESAM which encodes an endothelial cell adhesion molecule. The c.115del (p.Arg39Glyfs( *)33) variant, identified in six individuals from four independent families of Southeastern Anatolia, severely impaired the in vitro tubulogenic process of endothelial colony-forming cells, recapitulating previous evidence in null mice, and caused lack of ESAM expression in the capillary endothelial cells of damaged brain. Affected individuals with bi-allelic ESAM variants showed profound global developmental delay/unspecified intellectual disability, epilepsy, absent or severely delayed speech, varying degrees of spasticity, ventriculomegaly, and ICH/cerebral calcifications, the latter being also observed in the fetuses. Phenotypic traits observed in individuals with bi-allelic ESAM variants overlap very closely with other known conditions characterized by endothelial dysfunction due to mutation of genes encoding tight junction molecules. Our findings emphasize the role of brain endothelial dysfunction in NDDs and contribute to the expansion of an emerging group of diseases that we propose to rename as ""tightjunctionopathies."""
How has medical student learning changed with the pivot to online delivery of ophthalmology in the pandemic?,PloS one,2023,36996136,"PURPOSE: This study aimed to measure stakeholder satisfaction with our usual delivery format, which previously relied on a blend of didactic lectures and clinical skills sessions compared to a revised format, which had more emphasis on online learning. We hypothesised that the online flipped classroom (OFC) would facilitate delivery of content in the wake of the pandemic, and result in improved levels of student satisfaction and knowledge gain. DESIGN: Non randomised intervention study. Group 1 = Traditional delivery (TD) and Group 2 = OFC group. METHODS: A validated course evaluation questionnaire (CEQ) compared perspectives of teaching faculty (n = 5) and students with the traditional delivery (TD) of the 4th year ophthalmology clinical attachment and an OFC approach (TD n = 129 v OFC n = 114). RESULTS: The OFC group (n = 114; response rate = 24.6%) reported significantly reduced satisfaction with staff motivation of students and provision of feedback, compared to TD (n = 129; response rate = 17.8%). OFC students also felt it was harder to determine what standard of work was expected and found the course less beneficial at helping develop problem-solving skills. Students were dissatisfied with the level of choice afforded by the OFC, specifically how they would learn and assessment options. No significant difference in exam score was observed between the TD and OFC groups. For faculty (n = 5), there was no evidence of a difference between OFC and TD. CONCLUSIONS: Students indicated a preference for the TD compared to the OFC approach. However, both delivery approaches led to comparable student performances as determined by MCQ examination."
Educational attainment and trajectories at key stages of schooling for children with amblyopia compared to those without eye conditions: Findings from the Millennium Cohort Study.,PloS one,2023,36996127,"BACKGROUND: Amblyopia is a neurodevelopmental condition resulting in reduced vision for which whole population child vision screening is undertaken. Cross-sectional studies have established an association between amblyopia and lower academic self-concept, slower reading speed. No difference has been found in educational performance in adolescence whilst there are mixed associations with educational attainment in adults. Educational trajectories and intentions have not been studied previously. We analyse if those treated for amblyopia have different educational performance and trajectories for core subjects during statutory schooling, or subsequent higher education (university) intentions than their peers without eye conditions. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Data from the Millennium Cohort Study of children born in the United Kingdom in 2000-01 and followed-up to age 17 years (n = 9989). Using a validated approach drawing on parental self-report on eye conditions and treatment coded by clinical reviewers, participants were grouped into mutually exclusive categories: no eye conditions, strabismus alone, refractive amblyopia, strabismic/mixed (refractive plus strabismic) amblyopia. The outcomes were levels and trajectories of passing English, Maths, Science at ages 7-16 years, passing national exams at age 16, and intentions at ages 14-17 to pursue higher (university) education. Adjusted analyses showed that amblyopia status was not associated with performance in English, Maths, and Science at any key stage, attainment in national exams, or intending to go to university. Similarly, the age-related trajectories of performance in core subjects and higher education intentions did not differ between the groups. There were no significant differences in main reason for having or not having university intentions. CONCLUSIONS: We found no associations between a history of amblyopia and either adverse performance or age-related attainment trajectories in core subjects during key stages of statutory schooling as well as the absence of an association with intentions for higher education. These results should be reassuring to affected children and young people, and their families, teachers and physicians."
Botulinum toxin A for the treatment of strabismus in children with neurological impairment.,Arquivos brasileiros de oftalmologia,2023 Mar 24,36995810,"PURPOSES: To assess the efficacy of botulinum toxin A injection in the treatment of strabismus in patients with neurological impairment and evaluate the factors associated with treatment success. METHODS: The study included 50 patients with strabismus and neurological impairment. In all children, botulinum toxin injection was performed into the appropriate extraocular muscle. The relationship between demographic features, clinical characteristics, and treatment success were analyzed. RESULTS: In the study group, 34 patients had esotropia, and 16 patients had exotropia. As neurological problems, 36 patients had cerebral palsy, and 14 had hydrocephalus. The average follow-up period was 15.3 +/- 7.3 months. The mean number of injections was 1.4 +/- 0.6. The mean angle of deviation was 42.5 +/- 13.2 PD before the treatment, which decreased to 12.8 +/- 11.9 PD after the treatment. Successful motor alignment (orthotropia within 10 PD) was achieved in 60% of the patients. Binary logistic regression analysis revealed that esotropic misalignment and shorter duration of strabismus was significantly associated with treatment success in the study group. Patients with esotropia and lower angles of misalignment were more likely to be treated with a single injection. CONCLUSION: The use of botulinum toxin A for the treatment of strabismus in children with neurological impairment is a good alternative to conventional surgical therapy with a lower risk of overcorrection. The treatment outcome is better in esodeviations and shorter duration of strabismus, implying an advantage of early treatment."
Epidemiologic Pattern and Injury Mechanism of Intimate Partner Violence-Related Ocular Trauma in the US.,JAMA ophthalmology,2023 Mar 30,36995733,"IMPORTANCE: Intimate partner violence (IPV) is an important cause of death and disability worldwide. The literature estimates that 45% of IPV injuries involve the eyes. Many medical fields have increased IPV-related research; however, ophthalmology IPV research remains rare. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the epidemiologic pattern and injury mechanism of IPV related to ocular trauma. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This study was a retrospective cross-sectional analysis with deidentified data using the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM) codes from the National Trauma Data Bank (NTDB), which is a data set collected by the American College of Surgeons. The NTDB is the largest US hospitalized trauma case database with submissions from more than 900 US facilities. Included in this analysis were the IPV-related ocular injuries of patients hospitalized between 2017 and 2019. Study data were analyzed from April 20 to October 15, 2022. EXPOSURES: IPV-related ocular injuries. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Ocular injuries and adult IPV trauma survivors were identified with the ICD-10-CM codes. The following demographic data were collected: sex, age, race and ethnicity, health insurance plan, substance misuse screening results, trauma level of hospital, the emergency department disposition, the total Glasgow Coma Scale score, the abbreviated injury scale, and caregiver at discharge. RESULTS: A total of 2598 of the recorded ocular injuries were associated with IPV. Patients had a mean (SD) age of 45.2 (18.4) years, and 1618 were female (62.3%). Most patients in the population sample (1195 [46.0%]) were aged 18 to 39 years. The race and ethnicity distribution was as follows: 629 Black (24.2%), 296 Hispanic (11.4%), 1358 White (52.3%), 229 other (8.8%), and 86 missing (3.3%). Insurance statuses were Medicaid (847 [32.6%]), Medicare (524 [20.2%]), private insurance (524 [20.2%]), and self-pay (488 [18.8%]). Women had greater odds of testing positive during alcohol screening (odds ratio [OR], 1.42; 95% CI, 1.21-1.67; P < .001). Black patients were most likely to have Medicaid (OR, 1.64; 95% CI, 1.35-1.99; P < .001), Hispanic patients were most likely to self-pay (OR, 1.96, 95% CI, 1.48-2.58; P < .001), and White patients were most likely to use Medicare (OR, 2.94, 95% CI, 2.33-3.73; P < .001). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Social determinants of health were identified as key risk factors for IPV-related ocular injuries. Study findings highlight identifiable risk factors associated with IPV and ocular trauma that can contribute to IPV awareness among ophthalmologists."
"Association of variants in the ATXN2 (rs7137828), FOXC1 (rs2745572) and TXNRD2 (rs35934224) genes as risk factors for primary open-angle glaucoma development in a Brazilian cohort.",Ophthalmic genetics,2023 Mar 30,36994723,"BACKGROUND: Primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG), the world's main cause of irreversible blindness, is an asymptomatic and neurodegenerative disease of multifactorial etiology with ethnic and geographic disparities. Multiethnic genome-wide association studies (GWAS) identified single nucleotide variants (SNVs) in ATXN2, FOXC1, and TXNRD2 loci as risk factors for POAG pathophysiology and/or endophenotypes. The aim of this case-control study was to investigate the association of the variants rs7137828 (ATXN2), rs2745572 (FOXC1), and rs35934224 (TXNRD2), as risk factors for POAG development, additionally to rs7137828 association with glaucoma clinical parameters in a Brazilian cohort from the Southeast and South regions. METHODS: This investigation comprised 506 cases and 501 controls. Variants rs2745572 and rs35934224 were genotyped through TaqMan(R) assays and validated by Sanger sequencing. Variant rs7137828 was genotyped exclusively by Sanger sequencing. RESULTS: The primary research outcome revealed that the variant rs7137828 (ATXN2) was associated with an increased risk for the development of POAG in the presence of the TT genotype compared to the CC genotype (p = 0.006; Odds Ratio [OR] = 1.717; Confidence Interval [CI] 95% = 1.169-2.535). There was no significant association of rs2745572 and rs35934224 genotypes with POAG. The CT genotype of the rs7137828 was associated with the vertical cup-to-disk ratio (VCDR) (p = .023) but not with the age at diagnosis or the mean deviation. CONCLUSION: Our data indicate the rs7137828 associated with increased risk for the development of POAG and VCDR in a Brazilian cohort. If validated in additional populations, these findings may enable the development of relevant strategies for early diagnosis of glaucoma in the future."
Trends of rhino-orbito-cerebral mucormycosis in COVID-19 patients: An observational study.,Journal of family medicine and primary care,2022 Dec,36994064,"BACKGROUND AND AIM: Mucormycosis is a potentially lethal but rare fungal infection that is rapidly progressive. Rhino-orbito-cerebral mucormycosis (ROCM) was the predominant presentation of COVID-19-associated mucormycosis (CAM). Hence, the present study aimed to assess the oral manifestations in CAM patients admitted to the Indira Gandhi Institute of Medical Sciences-A Tertiary Health Care Center. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study was conducted on hospitalized patients admitted to our tertiary health care center during the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. A total of 54 patients were included in the study and were further evaluated for oral manifestations. Detailed history, clinical examination, and surgical exploration was done for all the subjects. All cases were confirmed by MRI and histopathology. RESULTS: Data collected was subjected to descriptive and inferential statistical analyses. Patients with oral manifestations were mostly in the age range of </=50 years which was 56.7% (n = 17). Male patients 56.7% were affected more as compared to female patients and most of the patients in our study were from rural areas 56.7%. RBS [Mean +/- standard deviation (SD)] was 304.60 +/- 100.073. On intra-oral examination 96.7% had a gingival and palatal abscess, 63.3% had tooth mobility, and palatal ulcer/perforation was seen among 56.7% of the patients. CONCLUSION: The second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic had also created an alarming situation in India and worldwide. Mucormycosis had come as a sudden storm which has created an emergency situation in our hospital and for dental practitioners also. This was also an alarming situation for a dental practitioner for evaluating early signs and symptoms, especially in high-risk patients and decreasing mortality."
Functional Peptide-Loaded Gelatin Nanoparticles as Eyedrops for Cornea Neovascularization Treatment.,International journal of nanomedicine,2023,36992821,"BACKGROUND: Corneal neovascularization (NV) is a process of abnormal vessel growth into the transparent cornea from the limbus and can disturb the light passing through the cornea, resulting in vision loss or even blindness. The use of nanomedicine as an effective therapeutic formulation in ophthalmology has led to higher drug bioavailability and a slow drug release rate. In this research, we designed and explored the feasibility of a new nanomedicine, gp91 ds-tat (gp91) peptide-encapsulated gelatin nanoparticles (GNP-gp91), for inhibiting corneal angiogenesis. METHODS: GNP-gp91 were prepared by a two-step desolvation method. The characterization and cytocompatibility of GNP-gp91 were analyzed. The inhibition effect of GNP-gp91 on HUVEC cell migration and tube formation was observed by an inverted microscope. The drug retention test in mouse cornea was observed by in vivo imaging system, fluorescence microscope, and DAPI/TAMRA staining. Finally, the therapeutic efficacy and evaluation of neovascularization-related factors were conducted through the in vivo corneal NV mice model via topical delivery. RESULTS: The prepared GNP-gp91 had a nano-scale diameter (550.6 nm) with positive charge (21.7 mV) slow-release behavior (25%, 240hr). In vitro test revealed that GNP-gp91 enhanced the inhibition of cell migration and tube formation capacity via higher internalization of HUVEC. Topical administration (eyedrops) of the GNP-gp91 significantly prolongs the retention time (46%, 20 min) in the mouse cornea. In chemically burned corneal neovascularization models, corneal vessel area with a significant reduction in GNP-gp91 group (7.89%) was revealed when compared with PBS (33.99%) and gp91 (19.67%) treated groups via every two days dosing. Moreover, GNP-gp91 significantly reduced the concentration of Nox2, VEGF and MMP9 in NV's cornea. CONCLUSION: The nanomedicine, GNP-gp91, was successfully synthesized for ophthalmological application. These data suggest that GNP-gp91 contained eyedrops that not only have a longer retention time on the cornea but also can treat mice corneal NV effectively delivered in a low dosing frequency, GNP-gp91 eyedrops provides an alternative strategy for clinical ocular disease treatment in the culture."
Increased Frequency of Diabetic Ketoacidosis: The Link With COVID-19 Pandemic.,Frontiers in clinical diabetes and healthcare,2022,36992744,"AIMS: Diabetic ketoacidosis is the most severe metabolic derangement due to prolonged insulin deficiency as in type 1 diabetes. Diabetic ketoacidosis, a life-threatening condition, is often diagnosed late. A timely diagnosis is mandatory to prevent its consequences, mainly neurological. The COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown have reduced the availability of medical care and access to hospitals. The aim of our retrospective study was to compare the frequency of ketoacidosis at the diagnosis of type 1 diabetes between the lockdown-post lockdown period and the previous two calendar years, in order to evaluate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We retrospectively assessed the clinical and metabolic data at the diagnosis of type 1 diabetes in children in the Liguria Region during 3 different time periods: calendar year 2018 (Period A), calendar year 2019 until February 23,2020 (Period B) and from February 24, 2020 onwards to March 31, 2021 (Period C). RESULTS: We analyzed 99 patients with newly-diagnosed T1DM from 01/01/2018 to 31/03/2021. Briefly, a younger age at diagnosis of T1DM was observed in Period 2 compared to Period 1 (p = 0.03). The frequency of DKA at clinical onset of T1DM was similar in Period A (32.3%) and Period B (37.5%), while it significantly increased in Period C (61.1%) compared to Period B (37.5%) (p = 0.03). PH values were similar in Period A (7.29 +/- 0.14) and Period B (7.27 +/- 0.17), while they were significantly lower in Period C (7.21 +/- 0.17) compared to Period B (p = 0.04). CONCLUSIONS: An increase in the frequency of diabetic ketoacidosis has been documented in newly diagnosed pediatric patients in the Liguria Region during and after the lockdown period compared to previous calendar years. This increase could have been caused by the delay in diagnosis following the restrictions imposed by the lockdown with consequently reduced access to health care facilities. More information on the risks of ketoacidosis is desirable by means of social and medical awareness campaigns."
"The co-development of a linguistic and culturally tailored tele-retinopathy screening intervention for immigrants living with diabetes from China and African-Caribbean countries in Ottawa, Canada.",BMC health services research,2023 Mar 29,36991464,"BACKGROUND: Diabetic retinopathy is a sight-threatening ocular complication of diabetes. Screening is an effective way to reduce severe complications, but screening attendance rates are often low, particularly for newcomers and immigrants to Canada and people from cultural and linguistic minority groups. Building on previous work, in partnership with patient and health system stakeholders, we co-developed a linguistically and culturally tailored tele-retinopathy screening intervention for people living with diabetes who recently immigrated to Canada from either China or African-Caribbean countries. METHODS: Following an environmental scan of diabetes eye care pathways in Ottawa, we conducted co-development workshops using a nominal group technique to create and prioritize personas of individuals requiring screening and identify barriers to screening that each persona may face. Next, we used the Theoretical Domains Framework to categorize the barriers/enablers and then mapped these categories to potential evidence-informed behaviour change techniques. Finally with these techniques in mind, participants prioritized strategies and channels of delivery, developed intervention content, and clarified actions required by different actors to overcome anticipated intervention delivery barriers. RESULTS: We carried out iterative co-development workshops with Mandarin and French-speaking individuals living with diabetes (i.e., patients in the community) who immigrated to Canada from China and African-Caribbean countries (n = 13), patient partners (n = 7), and health system partners (n = 6) recruited from community health centres in Ottawa. Patients in the community co-development workshops were conducted in Mandarin or French. Together, we prioritized five barriers to attending diabetic retinopathy screening: language (TDF Domains: skills, social influences), retinopathy familiarity (knowledge, beliefs about consequences), physician barriers regarding communication for screening (social influences), lack of publicity about screening (knowledge, environmental context and resources), and fitting screening around other activities (environmental context and resources). The resulting intervention included the following behaviour change techniques to address prioritized local barriers: information about health consequence, providing instructions on how to attend screening, prompts/cues, adding objects to the environment, social support, and restructuring the social environment. Operationalized delivery channels incorporated language support, pre-booking screening and sending reminders, social support via social media and community champions, and providing using flyers and videos as delivery channels. CONCLUSION: Working with intervention users and stakeholders, we co-developed a culturally and linguistically relevant tele-retinopathy intervention to address barriers to attending diabetic retinopathy screening and increase uptake among two under-served groups."

Investigation of the Relationship Between Cognitive Functions and Retinal Findings From Spectral Optical Coherence Tomography in Patients With Schizophrenia and Their Healthy Siblings.,Psychiatry investigation,2023 Mar,36990667,"OBJECTIVE: Retinal structural changes which were investigated by optical coherence tomography (OCT) have been reported in schizophrenia. Since cognitive dysfunction is a core feature of schizophrenia, the correlations between retinal findings and cognitive functions of patients and their healthy siblings may provide insight into the pathophysiological processes of the disorder. We aimed to investigate the relationship between neuropsychiatric tests and retinal changes in schizophrenia patients and their healthy siblings. METHODS: We measured OCT parameters and cognitive performance (via Trail Making Tests, verbal fluency tests, and The Digit Span Tests) of 72 participants (36 patients with schizophrenia and 36 healthy siblings) and disease severity (with Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale, Global Assessment of Functioning, and Clinical Global Impression scales) in patients with schizophrenia and evaluated the relationship between retinal findings and clinical parameters, especially neurocognitive tests. RESULTS: We found decreased ganglion cell layer-inner plexiform layer thickness and macular volume in the patient group. There were strong correlations between neurocognitive tests and OCT findings in both groups. On the other hand, there was not any correlation between retinal findings and disease parameters. CONCLUSION: The cognitive symptoms of schizophrenia may be more closely related to structural changes in the retina."
Factors Linked to Injection Interval Extension in Eyes with Wet Age-Related Macular Degeneration Switched to Brolucizumab.,Ophthalmology,2023 Mar 27,36990322,"PURPOSE: To evaluate factors associated with anti-VEGF injection interval extension in patients with neovascular age-related macular degeneration (nAMD) switched to brolucizumab. DESIGN: Retrospective observational cohort study. PARTICIPANTS: Adults in the US-based Intelligent Research in Sight (IRIS) Registry with nAMD who switched from another anti-VEGF agent (treatment-experienced) to brolucizumab-only treatment for at least 12 months in the time period of 10/08/2019 through 11/26/2021. METHODS: Univariate and multivariable analyses were used to examine associations of demographic and clinical characteristics with the likelihood of interval extension following switch to brolucizumab therapy. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Eyes were classified as either ""extenders"" or ""non-extenders"" at 12 months. ""Extenders"" were eyes that achieved (i) an extension of >/= 2 weeks in the brolucizumab injection interval at 12 months versus the pre-switch interval (time between the last known prior anti-VEGF injection and first [""index""] brolucizumab injection) and (ii) stable (< 10 letters gained or lost) or improved (>/= 10 letters gained) visual acuity (VA) at 12 months compared with VA at index. RESULTS: Of the 2015 eyes among 1890 patients that switched to brolucizumab, 1186 eyes (58.9%) were ""extenders"". In univariate analyses, demographic and clinical characteristics were comparable between extenders and non-extenders, except that extenders had a shorter pre-switch interval compared with non-extenders (mean 5.9 +/- 2.1 versus 10.1 +/- 7.6 weeks, respectively). The multivariable logistic regression model showed that a shorter pre-switch interval was significantly and positively associated with interval extension with brolucizumab therapy (adjusted odds ratio 5.6 for pre-switch interval of <8 weeks compared with >/=8 weeks; 95% confidence interval 4.5-6.9; P <0.001), and that eyes with an index VA of 40-65 letters were significantly less likely to be extenders than eyes in the higher (better) index VA categories. CONCLUSIONS: Length of the pre-switch treatment interval was the characteristic most strongly associated with successful interval extension with brolucizumab. Treatment-experienced patients who required more frequent injections (i.e., shorter pre-switch intervals) showed the greatest extensions when switching to brolucizumab. With careful consideration of the benefits/risks, brolucizumab may be a valuable treatment option for patients whose treatment burden is higher due to the need for frequent injections."
MicroRNAs of extracellular vesicles derived from mesenchymal stromal cells alleviate inflammation in dry eye disease by targeting the IRAK1/TAB2/NF-kappaB pathway.,The ocular surface,2023 Mar 27,36990276,"PURPOSE: To investigate the efficacy and mechanisms of human umbilical cord-derived MSC-derived extracellular vesicles (hucMSC-EVs) in a mouse model of desiccation-induced dry eye disease (DED). METHODS: hucMSC-EVs were enriched by ultracentrifugation. The DED model was induced by desiccating environment combined with scopolamine administration. The DED mice were divided into the hucMSC-EVs group, fluorometholone (FML) group, PBS group, and blank control group. Tear secretion, corneal fluorescein staining, the cytokine profiles in tears and goblet cells, TUNEL-positive cell, and CD4(+) cells were examined to assess therapeutic efficiency. The miRNAs in the hucMSC-EVs were sequenced, and the top 10 were used for miRNA enrichment analysis and annotation. The targeted DED-related signaling pathway was further verified by using RT‒qPCR and western blotting. RESULTS: Treatment with hucMSC-EVs increased the tear volume and maintained corneal integrity in DED mice. The cytokine profile in the tears of the hucMSC-EVs group presented with a lower level of proinflammatory cytokines than PBS group. Moreover, hucMSC-EVs treatment increased goblet cell density and inhibited cell apoptosis and CD4(+) cell infiltration. Functional analysis of the top 10 miRNAs in hucMSC-EVs showed a high correlation with immunity. Among them, miR-125 b, let-7b, and miR-6873 were conserved between humans and mice and were associated with the IRAK1/TAB2/NF-kappaB pathway that was activated in DED. Furthermore, IRAK1/TAB2/NF-kappaB pathway activation and the abnormal expression of IL-4, IL-8, IL-10, IL-13, IL-17, and TNF-alpha were reversed by hucMSC-EVs. CONCLUSIONS: hucMSCs-EVs alleviate DED signs, suppress inflammation and restore homeostasis of the corneal surface by multitargeting the IRAK1/TAB2/NF-kappaB pathway via certain miRNAs."
Successful restoration of corneal surface integrity with a tissue-engineered allogeneic implant in severe keratitis patients.,Biomedicine & pharmacotherapy = Biomedecine & pharmacotherapie,2023 Mar 27,36989713,"OBJECTIVES: Corneal diseases are among the main causes of blindness, with approximately 4.6 and 23 million patients worldwide suffering from bilateral and unilateral corneal blindness, respectively. The standard treatment for severe corneal diseases is corneal transplantation. However, relevant disadvantages, particularly in high-risk conditions, have focused the attention on the search for alternatives. METHODS: We report interim findings of a phase I-II clinical study evaluating the safety and preliminary efficacy of a tissue-engineered corneal substitute composed of a nanostructured fibrin-agarose biocompatible scaffold combined with allogeneic corneal epithelial and stromal cells (NANOULCOR). 5 subjects (5 eyes) suffering from trophic corneal ulcers refractory to conventional treatments, who combined stromal degradation or fibrosis and limbal stem cell deficiency, were included and treated with this allogeneic anterior corneal substitute. RESULTS: The implant completely covered the corneal surface, and ocular surface inflammation decreased following surgery. Only four adverse reactions were registered, and none of them were severe. No detachment, ulcer relapse nor surgical re-interventions were registered after 2 years of follow-up. No signs of graft rejection, local infection or corneal neovascularization were observed either. Efficacy was measured as a significant postoperative improvement in terms of the eye complication grading scales. Anterior segment optical coherence tomography images revealed a more homogeneous and stable ocular surface, with complete scaffold degradation occurring within 3-12 weeks after surgery. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that the surgical application of this allogeneic anterior human corneal substitute is feasible and safe, showing partial efficacy in the restoration of the corneal surface."
Pathologically high intraocular pressure induces mitochondrial dysfunction through Drp1 and leads to retinal ganglion cell PANoptosis in glaucoma.,Redox biology,2023 Mar 21,36989574,"Glaucoma is a common neurodegenerative disease characterized by progressive retinal ganglion cell (RGC) loss and visual field defects. Pathologically high intraocular pressure (ph-IOP) is an important risk factor for glaucoma, and it triggers molecularly distinct cascades that control RGC death and axonal degeneration. Dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1)-mediated abnormalities in mitochondrial dynamics are involved in glaucoma pathogenesis; however, little is known about the precise pathways that regulate RGC injury and death. Here, we aimed to investigate the role of the ERK1/2-Drp1-reactive oxygen species (ROS) axis in RGC death and the relationship between Drp1-mediated mitochondrial dynamics and PANoptosis in ph-IOP injury. Our results suggest that inhibiting the ERK1/2-Drp1-ROS pathway is a potential therapeutic strategy for treating ph-IOP-induced injuries. Furthermore, inhibiting Drp1 can regulate RGC PANoptosis by modulating caspase3-dependent, nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-like receptor-containing pyrin domain 3(NLRP3)-dependent, and receptor-interacting protein (RIP)-dependent pathways in the ph-IOP model. Overall, our findings provide new insights into possible protective interventions that could regulate mitochondrial dynamics to improve RGC survival."
"The photoreceptor protective cGMP-analog Rp-8-Br-PET-cGMPS interacts with cGMP-interactors PKGI, PDE1, PDE6, and PKAI in the degenerating mouse retina.",The Journal of comparative neurology,2023 Mar 29,36989379,"The inherited eye disease retinitis pigmentosa (RP) causes the loss of photoreceptors by a still unknown cell death mechanism. During this degeneration, cyclic guanosine-3',5'-monophosphate (cGMP) levels become elevated, leading to over-activation of the cGMP-binding protein cGMP-dependent protein kinase (PKG). cGMP analogs selectively modified to have inhibitory actions on PKG have aided in impeding photoreceptor death, and one such cGMP analog is Rp-8-Br-PET-cGMPS. However, cGMP analogs have previously been shown to interact with numerous targets, so to better understand the therapeutic action of Rp-8-Br-PET-cGMPS, it is necessary to elucidate its target-selectivity and hence what potential cellular mechanism(s) it may affect within the photoreceptors. Here, we, therefore, applied affinity chromatography together with mass spectrometry to isolate and identify Rp-8-Br-PET-cGMPS interactors from retinas derived from three different murine RP models (i.e., rd1, rd2, and rd10 mice). Our findings revealed that Rp-8-Br-PET-cGMPS bound seven known cGMP-binding proteins, including PKG1beta, PDE1beta, PDE1c, PDE6alpha, and PKA1alpha. Furthermore, an additional 28 proteins were found to be associated with Rp-8-Br-PET-cGMPS. This latter group included MAPK1/3, which is known to connect with cGMP/PKG in other systems. However, in organotypic retinal cultures, Rp-8-Br-PET-cGMPS had no effect on photoreceptor MAPK1/3 expression or activity. To summarize, Rp-8-Br-PET-cGMPS is more target specific compared to regular cGMP."
Robust Acute Pancreatitis Identification and Diagnosis: RAPIDx.,ACS nano,2023 Mar 29,36988967,"The occurrence of acute pancreatitis (AP) is increasing significantly worldwide. However, current diagnostic methods of AP do not provide a clear clinical stratification of severity, and the prediction of complications in AP is still limited. Here, we present a robust AP identification and diagnosis (RAPIDx) method by the proteomic fingerprinting of intact nanoscale extracellular vesicles (EVs) from clinical samples. By tracking analysis of circulating biological nanoparticles released by cells (i.e., EVs) via bottom-up proteomics, we obtain close phenotype connections between EVs, cell types, and multiple tissues based on their specific proteomes and identify the serum amyloid A (SAA) proteins on EVs as potential biomarkers that are differentially expressed from AP patients significantly. We accomplish the quantitative analysis of EVs fingerprints using MALDI-TOF MS and find the SAA proteins (SAA1-1, desR-SAA1-2, SAA2, SAA1-2) with areas under the curve (AUCs) from 0.92 to 0.97, which allows us to detect AP within 30 min. We further realize that SAA1-1 and SAA2, combined with two protein peaks (5290.19, 14032.33 m/z), can achieve an AUC of 0.83 for classifying the severity of AP. The RAPIDx platform will facilitate timely diagnosis and treatment of AP before severity development and persistent organ failure and promote precision diagnostics and the early diagnosis of pancreatic cancer."
Quadrant Asymmetry in Optical Coherence Tomography Angiography Metrics in Ischemic Versus Non-Ischemic Central Retinal Vein Occlusion Eyes.,Translational vision science & technology,2023 Mar 1,36988945,"PURPOSE: To determine whether quadrant asymmetry (QA) of optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) metrics differs between non-ischemic versus ischemic central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO). METHODS: Fifty-eight eyes (21 non-ischemic, 10 ischemic CRVO, and 27 contralateral control eyes) underwent 3 x 3 mm spectral-domain OCTA scans with quantification of the superficial retinal layer vessel length density (VLD) and perfusion density (PD). QA, defined as the maximum-minus-minimum value among four parafoveal Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) quadrants, was compared by linear regression including fixed effects for each eye. RESULTS: Mean age was 73.6 +/- 11.4 (range 39-88), 73.8 +/- 12.4 (range 39-91) and 77.2 +/- 9.83, (range 60-88); and QA was 3.46 +/- 1.76, 3.14 +/- 1.57, and 4.88 +/- 2.42 for VLD and 0.072 +/- 0.038, 0.062 +/- 0.036, and 0.11 +/- 0.056 for PD for control, non-ischemic, and ischemic, respectively. QA was significantly higher in ischemic (0.109 +/- 0.056) than non-ischemic CRVO eyes (0.062 +/- 0.036; P = 0.02) and control eyes for PD (0.072 +/- 0.038; P = 0.03). QA was also greater in ischemic (4.875 +/- 2.418) than non-ischemic CRVO (3.141 +/- 1.572) for VLD (P = 0.04). In terms of identifying which particular quadrant is most affected by ischemia, multivariate regression analysis comparing intra-quadrant effect on the presence of ischemia versus non-ischemia showed no quadrant was significantly affected (P > 0.05 for all quadrants). CONCLUSIONS: Ischemic CRVO increases intraeye QA of OCTA metrics when compared to non-ischemic CRVO and control eyes. No specific ETDRS quadrant appears to be more affected. TRANSLATIONAL RELEVANCE: This work uses an intraeye method to delineate between ischemic and non-ischemic CRVO by OCTA imaging, overcoming inter-eye variables encountered in clinical care."
EULAR study group on 'MHC-I-opathy': identifying disease-overarching mechanisms across disciplines and borders.,Annals of the rheumatic diseases,2023 Mar 27,36987655,"The 'MHC-I (major histocompatibility complex class I)-opathy' concept describes a family of inflammatory conditions with overlapping clinical manifestations and a strong genetic link to the MHC-I antigen presentation pathway. Classical MHC-I-opathies such as spondyloarthritis, Behcet's disease, psoriasis and birdshot uveitis are widely recognised for their strong association with certain MHC-I alleles and gene variants of the antigen processing aminopeptidases ERAP1 and ERAP2 that implicates altered MHC-I peptide presentation to CD8+T cells in the pathogenesis. Progress in understanding the cause and treatment of these disorders is hampered by patient phenotypic heterogeneity and lack of systematic investigation of the MHC-I pathway.Here, we discuss new insights into the biology of MHC-I-opathies that strongly advocate for disease-overarching and integrated molecular and clinical investigation to decipher underlying disease mechanisms. Because this requires transformative multidisciplinary collaboration, we introduce the EULAR study group on MHC-I-opathies to unite clinical expertise in rheumatology, dermatology and ophthalmology, with fundamental and translational researchers from multiple disciplines such as immunology, genomics and proteomics, alongside patient partners. We prioritise standardisation of disease phenotypes and scientific nomenclature and propose interdisciplinary genetic and translational studies to exploit emerging therapeutic strategies to understand MHC-I-mediated disease mechanisms. These collaborative efforts are required to address outstanding questions in the etiopathogenesis of MHC-I-opathies towards improving patient treatment and prognostication."
Biomedical Applications of Lactoferrin on the Ocular Surface.,Pharmaceutics,2023 Mar 7,36986726,"Lactoferrin (LF) is a first-line defense protein with a pleiotropic functional pattern that includes anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory, antiviral, antibacterial, and antitumoral properties. Remarkably, this iron-binding glycoprotein promotes iron retention, restricting free radical production and avoiding oxidative damage and inflammation. On the ocular surface, LF is released from corneal epithelial cells and lacrimal glands, representing a significant percentage of the total tear fluid proteins. Due to its multifunctionality, the availability of LF may be limited in several ocular disorders. Consequently, to reinforce the action of this highly beneficial glycoprotein on the ocular surface, LF has been proposed for the treatment of different conditions such as dry eye, keratoconus, conjunctivitis, and viral or bacterial ocular infections, among others. In this review, we outline the structure and the biological functions of LF, its relevant role at the ocular surface, its implication in LF-related ocular surface disorders, and its potential for biomedical applications."
Perspectives of Therapeutic Drug Monitoring of Biological Agents in Non-Infectious Uveitis Treatment: A Review.,Pharmaceutics,2023 Feb 25,36986627,"Biological drugs, especially those targeting anti-tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha) molecule, have revolutionized the treatment of patients with non-infectious uveitis (NIU), a sight-threatening condition characterized by ocular inflammation that can lead to severe vision threatening and blindness. Adalimumab (ADA) and infliximab (IFX), the most widely used anti-TNFalpha drugs, have led to greater clinical benefits, but a significant fraction of patients with NIU do not respond to these drugs. The therapeutic outcome is closely related to systemic drug levels, which are influenced by several factors such as immunogenicity, concomitant treatment with immunomodulators, and genetic factors. Therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) of drug and anti-drug antibody (ADAbs) levels is emerging as a resource to optimise biologic therapy by personalising treatment to bring and maintain drug concentration within the therapeutic range, especially in those patients where a clinical response is less than expected. Furthermore, some studies have described different genetic polymorphisms that may act as predictors of response to treatment with anti-TNFalpha agents in immune-mediated diseases and could be useful in personalising biologic treatment selection. This review is a compilation of the published evidence in NIU and in other immune-mediated diseases that support the usefulness of TDM and pharmacogenetics as a tool to guide clinicians' treatment decisions leading to better clinical outcomes. In addition, findings from preclinical and clinical studies, assessing the safety and efficacy of intravitreal administration of anti-TNFalpha agents in NIU are discussed."
Updates on Biodegradable Formulations for Ocular Drug Delivery.,Pharmaceutics,2023 Feb 22,36986595,"The complex nature of the ocular drug delivery barrier presents a significant challenge to the effective administration of drugs, resulting in poor therapeutic outcomes. To address this issue, it is essential to investigate new drugs and alternative delivery routes and vehicles. One promising approach is the use of biodegradable formulations to develop potential ocular drug delivery technologies. These include hydrogels, biodegradable microneedles, implants, and polymeric nanocarriers such as liposomes, nanoparticles, nanosuspensions, nanomicelles, and nanoemulsions. The research in these areas is rapidly growing. In this review, we provide an overview of recent updates in biodegradable formulations for ocular drug delivery over the past decade. Additionally, we examine the clinical use of different biodegradable formulations in various ocular diseases. The aim of this review is to gain a deeper understanding of potential future trends in biodegradable ocular drug delivery systems and to raise awareness of their potential for practical clinical application as a means of providing new treatment options for ocular diseases."
Metabolomics in Corneal Diseases: A Narrative Review from Clinical Aspects.,Metabolites,2023 Mar 3,36984820,"Corneal pathologies may have subtle manifestations in the initial stages, delaying diagnosis and timely treatment. This can lead to irreversible visual loss. Metabolomics is a rapidly developing field that allows the study of metabolites in a system, providing a complementary tool in the early diagnosis and management of corneal diseases. Early identification of biomarkers is key to prevent disease progression. The advancement of nuclear magnetic resonance and mass spectrometry allows the identification of new biomarkers in the analysis of tear, cornea, and aqueous humor. Novel perspectives on disease mechanisms are identified, which provide vital information for potential targeted therapies in the future. Current treatments are analyzed at a molecular level to offer further information regarding their efficacy. In this article, we provide a comprehensive review of the metabolomic studies undertaken in the cornea and various pathologies such as dry eye disease, Sjogren's syndrome, keratoconus, post-refractive surgery, contact lens wearers, and diabetic corneas. Lastly, we discuss the exciting future that metabolomics plays in cornea research."
Tinnitus Prevalence in the Adult Population-Results from the Gutenberg Health Study.,"Medicina (Kaunas, Lithuania)",2023 Mar 20,36984621,"Background and Objectives: Tinnitus is a common symptom in medical practice, although data on its prevalence vary. As the underlying pathophysiological mechanism is still not fully understood, hearing loss is thought to be an important risk factor for the occurrence of tinnitus. The aim of this study was to assess tinnitus prevalence in a large German cohort and to determine its dependence on hearing impairment. Materials and Methods: The Gutenberg Health Study (GHS) is a population-based cohort study and representative for the population of Mainz and its district. Participants were asked whether they suffer from tinnitus and how much they are burdened by it. Extensive audiological examinations using bone- and air-conduction were also performed. Results: 4942 participants (mean age: 61.0, 2550 men and 2392 women) were included in the study. The overall prevalence of tinnitus was 26.1%. Men were affected significantly more often than women. The prevalence of tinnitus increased with age, peaking at ages 75 to 79 years. Considering only annoying tinnitus, the prevalence was 9.8%. Logistic regression showed that participants with severe to complete hearing loss (>65 dB) were more likely to have tinnitus. Conclusions: Tinnitus is a common symptom, and given demographic changes, its prevalence is expected to increase."
Role of Microaneurysms in the Pathogenesis and Therapy of Diabetic Macular Edema: A Descriptive Review.,"Medicina (Kaunas, Lithuania)",2023 Feb 22,36984436,"Background and Objectives: This study aims to elucidate the role of microaneurysms (MAs) in the pathogenesis and treatment of diabetic retinopathy (DR) and diabetic macular edema (DME), the major causes of acquired visual impairment. Materials and Methods: We synthesized the relevance of findings on the clinical characteristics, pathogenesis, and etiology of MAs in DR and DME and their role in anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) therapy. Results: MAs, a characteristic feature in DR and DME, can be detected by fluorescein angiography, optical coherence tomography (OCT) and OCT angiography. These instrumental analyses demonstrated a geographic and functional association between MA and ischemic areas. MA turnover, the production and loss of MA, reflects the activity of DME and DR. Several cytokines are involved in the pathogenesis of MAs, which is characterized by pericyte loss and endothelial cell proliferation in a VEGF-dependent or -independent manner. Ischemia and MAs localized in the deep retinal layers are characteristic of refractory DME cases. Even in the current anti-VEGF era, laser photocoagulation targeting MAs in the focal residual edema is still an effective therapeutic tool, but it is necessary to be creative in accurately identifying the location of MAs and performing highly precise and minimally invasive coagulation. Conclusions: MAs play a distinctive and important role in the pathogenesis of the onset, progression of DR and DME, and response to anti-VEGF treatment. Further research on MA is significant not only for understanding the pathogenesis of DME but also for improving the effectiveness of treatment."
The Eye as a Diagnostic Tool for Alzheimer's Disease.,"Life (Basel, Switzerland)",2023 Mar 8,36983883,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder impacting cognition, function, and behavior in the elderly population. While there are currently no disease-modifying agents capable of curing AD, early diagnosis and management in the preclinical stage can significantly improve patient morbidity and life expectancy. Currently, the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease is a clinical one, often supplemented by invasive and expensive biomarker testing. Over the last decade, significant advancements have been made in our understanding of AD and the role of ocular tissue as a potential biomarker. Ocular biomarkers hold the potential to provide noninvasive and easily accessible diagnostic and monitoring capabilities. This review summarizes current research for detecting biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease in ocular tissue."
Is Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate Necessary for the Initial Diagnosis of Giant Cell Arteritis?,"Life (Basel, Switzerland)",2023 Mar 3,36983848,"Giant cell arteritis (GCA) is an ophthalmological emergency that can be difficult to diagnose and prompt treatment is vital. We investigated the sequential diagnostic value for patients with suspected GCA using three biochemical measures as they arrive to the clinician: first, platelet count, then C-reactive protein (CRP), and lastly, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR). This retrospective cross-sectional study of consecutive patients with suspected GCA investigated platelet count, CRP, and ESR using diagnostic test accuracy statistics and odds ratios (ORs) in a sequential fashion. The diagnosis was established by experts at follow-up, considering clinical findings and tests including temporal artery biopsy. A total of 94 patients were included, of which 37 (40%) were diagnosed with GCA. Compared with those without GCA, patients with GCA had a higher platelet count (p < 0.001), CRP (p < 0.001), and ESR (p < 0.001). Platelet count demonstrated a low sensitivity (38%) and high specificity (88%); CRP, a high sensitivity (86%) and low specificity (56%); routine ESR, a high sensitivity (89%) and low specificity (47%); and age-adjusted ESR, a moderate sensitivity (65%) and moderate specificity (65%). Sequential analysis revealed that ESR did not provide additional value in evaluating risk of GCA. Initial biochemical evaluation can be based on platelet count and CRP, without waiting for ESR, which allows faster initial decision-making in GCA."
"Anti-VEGF Treatment of Diabetic Macular Edema in Denmark: Incidence, Burden of Therapy, and Forecasting Analyses.",Journal of personalized medicine,2023 Mar 18,36983726,"BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to analyze demographically stratified incidence rates of patients with diabetic macular edema (DME) commenced in anti-VEGF therapy, to study temporal trends, to report the proportion of patients in active therapy over time, and to develop a model to forecast the future number of patients in active treatment. METHODS: This was a retrospective registry-based study of all patients with DME who received at least one intravitreal anti-VEGF treatment from 1 January 2007 to 30 June 2022. Population data were extracted from Statistics Denmark. RESULTS: This study included 2220 patients with DME who were commenced in anti-VEGF therapy. Demographic analyses revealed higher incidence rates among males than females and among those aged 60-80 years. The number of patients in active treatment followed an exponential decay curve; hence, this was used to mathematically model the number of patients in active therapy. The number of patients in active treatment is expected to stay relatively stable with a minimal increase until the year 2023. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides insight into the practical aspects of the anti-VEGF treatment of DME that allow the planning of adequate health services."
The Association of Intravitreal Injections of Different Anti-Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor with Systemic Outcomes in Diabetic Patients.,Journal of personalized medicine,2023 Mar 18,36983725,"This retrospective cohort study aimed to assess the systemic effects of three commonly available anti-vascular endothelial growth factor intravitreal injections in patients with diabetes, using data taken from a multi-institutional database in Taiwan. Patient data were sourced from the multi-institutional Chang Gung Research Database. Participants were divided into groups based on treatment with bevacizumab, ranibizumab, or aflibercept. Baseline characteristics were matched among the groups by the inverse probability of treatment weighting. The incidence rate of outcome events was calculated as the number of events divided by 100 person-years of follow-up. The cumulative incidence function was used to estimate the incidence rate of the outcome events among groups. The incidence of ischemic stroke was higher in the ranibizumab group than the bevacizumab and aflibercept groups (1.65, 0.92, and 0.61 per 100 person-years, respectively). The incidence of major adverse lower-limb events was higher in the bevacizumab group (2.95), followed by ranibizumab (2.00) and aflibercept (0.74). Major bleeding was relatively higher in bevacizumab (12.1) compared to ranibizumab (4.3) and aflibercept (3.8). All-cause death was higher for both bevacizumab (3.26) and aflibercept (2.61) when compared to ranibizumab (0.55), and all-cause admission was found to be highest with bevacizumab (58.6), followed by aflibercept (30.2), and ranibizumab (27.6). The bevacizumab group demonstrated a greater decrease in glycated hemoglobin compared to the baseline level (-0.33%). However, a few differences in the clinical condition between the groups were still observed after matching. In conclusion, this study suggests that different anti-vascular endothelial growth factor agents may be associated with various and differing systemic adverse events. The differences might also be attributed to differences in patient characteristics and clinical status."
Automatic Diagnosis of Infectious Keratitis Based on Slit Lamp Images Analysis.,Journal of personalized medicine,2023 Mar 13,36983701,"Infectious keratitis (IK) is a common ophthalmic emergency that requires prompt and accurate treatment. This study aimed to propose a deep learning (DL) system based on slit lamp images to automatically screen and diagnose infectious keratitis. This study established a dataset of 2757 slit lamp images from 744 patients, including normal cornea, viral keratitis (VK), fungal keratitis (FK), and bacterial keratitis (BK). Six different DL algorithms were developed and evaluated for the classification of infectious keratitis. Among all the models, the EffecientNetV2-M showed the best classification ability, with an accuracy of 0.735, a recall of 0.680, and a specificity of 0.904, which was also superior to two ophthalmologists. The area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC) of the EffecientNetV2-M was 0.85; correspondingly, 1.00 for normal cornea, 0.87 for VK, 0.87 for FK, and 0.64 for BK. The findings suggested that the proposed DL system could perform well in the classification of normal corneas and different types of infectious keratitis, based on slit lamp images. This study proves the potential of the DL model to help ophthalmologists to identify infectious keratitis and improve the accuracy and efficiency of diagnosis."
TIPE2 Inhibits MGD Inflammation by Regulating Macrophage Polarization.,Journal of personalized medicine,2023 Mar 9,36983674,"BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to decide the role of the polarization of macrophages regulated by tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha)-induced protein 8-like 2 (TIPE2) in meibomian gland dysfunction (MGD). METHODS: Firstly, the secretory function of the meibomian gland (MG) in apolipoprotein E knockout (ApoE(-/-)) MGD mice and normal mice was detected by oil red staining. Then, the expression levels of markers of M1 and M2 macrophages were detected by immunofluorescence staining in MGD, normal mice, and mild and severe MGD corpses to decide the role of M1 and M2 macrophages in MGD inflammation. Meanwhile, the expression levels of TIPE2 in MGD mice and MGD patients were detected by immunofluorescence staining, and the correlations among TIPE2, M1 and M2 macrophages were analyzed by immunofluorescence double staining in MGD mice and MGD patients. Furthermore, lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and interleulkin-4 (IL-4) were used to induce M1 and M2 polarization of macrophages, and the mRNA level of TIPE2 was detected in M1 and M2 macrophages. RESULTS: Oil red staining showed that eyelid fat congestion was more severe in (ApoE(-/-)) MGD mice than in normal mice, and the M1 macrophage was the primary inflammatory cell infiltrated in (ApoE(-/-)) MGD mice (p < 0.05). The results of the immunofluorescence staining showed that the infiltration of macrophages in MGD mice was more obvious than that in the normal group, and M1 macrophage was the dominant group (p < 0.05). Similar to the results of the MGD mouse model, more macrophage infiltration was observed in MGD patients' MG tissues, and there were more M1 cells in the severe group than in the mild group (p < 0.05). Moreover, the expression of TIPE2 was positively correlated with the expression of M2 macrophages in MGD patients and mice MG tissues (p < 0.05). The expression of TIPE2 mRNA in LPS-induced M1 macrophages declined, while the expression of TIPE2 mRNA in IL-4-induced M2 macrophages increased (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: M1 macrophage was the dominant group infiltrated in the MG tissue of MGD, and TIPE2 is a potential anti-inflammatory target for preventing the development of MGD by promoting the M2 polarization of macrophages."
Correction of Asymmetric Bowtie Corneal Astigmatism with a Toric Intraocular Lens: Outcomes and Accuracy of Measurement Modes.,Journal of personalized medicine,2023 Feb 24,36983583,"The outcomes of toric intraocular lens (IOL) implantation in correcting asymmetric bowtie corneal astigmatism remain uncertain. The accurate measurement of corneal astigmatism is essential for surgical planning. In this prospective cohort study, patients with asymmetric or symmetric bowtie corneal astigmatism who underwent toric IOL implantation were recruited. Preoperative corneal astigmatism was measured with an IOLMaster and Pentacam (including the simulated keratometry (SimK), total corneal refractive power (TCRP), and wavefront aberration (WFA) modes). At 3 months after surgery, the refractive outcomes and residual astigmatic refractive errors were compared with patients with symmetric bowtie astigmatism. The prediction errors (the differences between the calculated actual corneal astigmatism and the measured corneal astigmatism) were compared among the different measurement modes in the asymmetric group. There were no differences in residual astigmatism between the asymmetric and symmetric groups. However, the mean absolute residual astigmatic refractive error was greater in the asymmetric group than in the symmetric group (0.72 +/- 0.42 D vs. 0.53 +/- 0.24 D, p = 0.043). In the asymmetric group, the mean absolute prediction errors for the IOLMaster, SimK, TCRP and WFA modes were 0.53 +/- 0.40, 0.56 +/- 0.47, 0.68 +/- 0.52, and 0.43 +/- 0.40 D, respectively. The Pentacam WFA mode was the most accurate mode (p < 0.05). The absolute prediction error of the WFA mode was positively correlated with the total corneal irregular astigmatism higher-order aberrations and coma (r = 0.416 and r = 0.473, respectively; both p < 0.05). Our study suggests toric IOL implantation effectively corrected asymmetric bowtie corneal astigmatism. The Pentacam WFA mode may be the most accurate measurement mode, although its accuracy decreased as asymmetry increased."
MLN4924 Promotes Self-Renewal of Limbal Stem Cells and Ocular Surface Restoration.,Journal of personalized medicine,2023 Feb 21,36983561,"OBJECTIVE: To study the role of MLN4924 in corneal stem cell maintenance and corneal injury repair. METHODS: In cell experiments, the Sprague-Dawley (SD) rat corneal epithelial cells were co-cultured with mitomycin C-inactivated mouse feeder cells in a supplemental hormonal epithelial medium (SHEM) with or without MLN4924. Cells were photographed using an optical microscope. Furthermore, we performed crystal violet, polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and immunofluorescence staining on limbal stem cells (LSCs). In animal experiments, we scraped the corneal epithelium with a central corneal diameter of 4 mm in SD rats. The area of the corneal epithelial defect was calculated by fluorescein sodium staining. RESULTS: LSCs in the MLN4924 group had significantly proliferated. The MLN4924 treatment evidently enhanced the clone formation rate and clone area of LSCs. The expression levels of Ki67, p63, ABCG2, Bmi1, and C/EBPdelta increased in LSCs after MLN4924 treatment, whereas the expression of K12 decreased. At 12 and 24 h after scraping, the corneal epithelium recovery rate in the eyes of the MLN4924-treated rats was accelerated. CONCLUSIONS: MLN4924 can maintain stemness, reduce differentiation, promote the proliferative capacity of rat LSCs, and accelerate corneal epithelial wound healing in SD rats."
Pyridostigmine Bromide Pills and Pesticides Exposure as Risk Factors for Eye Disease in Gulf War Veterans.,Journal of clinical medicine,2023 Mar 21,36983407,"To examine associations between the pyridostigmine bromide (PB) pill and/or pesticide exposure during the 1990-1991 Gulf War (GW) and eye findings years after deployment. A cross-sectional study of South Florida veterans who were deployed on active duty during the GW Era (GWE). Information on GW exposures and ocular surface symptoms were collected via standardized questionnaires and an ocular surface examination was performed. Participants underwent spectral domain-ocular coherence tomography (SD-OCT) imaging that included retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL), ganglion cell layer (GCL), and macular maps. We examined for differences in eye findings between individuals exposed versus not exposed to PB pills or pesticides during service. A total of 40.7% (n = 44) of individuals reported exposure to PB pills and 41.7% (n = 45) to pesticides; additionally, 24 reported exposure to both in the GW arena. Demographics were comparable across groups. Individuals exposed to PB pills reported higher dry eye (DE) symptoms scores (the 5-Item Dry Eye Questionnaire, DEQ-5: 9.3 +/- 5.3 vs. 7.3 +/- 4.7, p = 0.04) and more intense ocular pain (average over the last week: 2.4 +/- 2.6 vs. 1.5 +/- 1.8, p = 0.03; Neuropathic Pain Symptom Inventory modified for the Eye (NPSI-E): 18.2 +/- 20.0 vs. 10.8 +/- 13.8, p = 0.03) compared to their non-exposed counterparts. DE signs were comparable between the groups. Individuals exposed to PB pills also had thicker OCT measurements, with the largest difference in the outer temporal segment of the macula (268.5 +/- 22.2 mum vs. 260.6 +/- 14.5 mum, p = 0.03) compared to non-exposed individuals. These differences remained significant when examined in multivariable models that included demographics and deployment history. Individuals exposed to pesticides had higher neuropathic ocular pain scores (NPSI-E: 17.1 +/- 21.1 vs. 11.6 +/- 12.9, p = 0.049), but this difference did not remain significant in a multivariable model. Individuals exposed to PB pills during the GWE reported more severe ocular surface symptoms and had thicker OCT measures years after deployment compared to their non-exposed counterparts."
Retinal Ischaemia in Diabetic Retinopathy: Understanding and Overcoming a Therapeutic Challenge.,Journal of clinical medicine,2023 Mar 21,36983406,"BACKGROUND: Retinal ischaemia is present to a greater or lesser extent in all eyes with diabetic retinopathy (DR). Nonetheless, our understanding of its pathogenic mechanisms, risk factors, as well as other characteristics of retinal ischaemia in DR is very limited. To date, there is no treatment to revascularise ischaemic retina. METHODS: Review of the literature highlighting the current knowledge on the topic of retinal ischaemia in DR, important observations made, and underlying gaps for which research is needed. RESULTS: A very scarce number of clinical studies, mostly cross-sectional, have evaluated specifically retinal ischaemia in DR. Interindividual variability on its natural course and consequences, including the development of its major complications, namely diabetic macular ischaemia and proliferative diabetic retinopathy, have not been investigated. The in situ, surrounding, and distance effect of retinal ischaemia on retinal function and structure and its change over time remains also to be elucidated. Treatments to prevent the development of retinal ischaemia and, importantly, to achieve retinal reperfusion once capillary drop out has ensued, are very much needed and remain to be developed. CONCLUSION: Research into retinal ischaemia in diabetes should be a priority to save sight."
Bowman Layer Transplantation for Treating Keratoconus-Preliminary Findings.,Journal of clinical medicine,2023 Mar 20,36983402,"(1) Background: Mid-stromal isolated Bowman layer transplantation aims to reduce and stabilize corneal ectasia in patients with advanced, progressive keratoconus. The purpose of this review is to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of this new surgical technique. (2) Methods: Following the PRISMA statement and checklist, we searched Medline, the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register, and Embase and used a broad systematic search strategy according to the Cochrane Collaboration. (3) Results: Eight studies with a total number of 120 eyes of 106 patients met our inclusion criteria. One month after Bowman layer transplantation, patients with keratoconus showed a significant decrease in the measured simulated keratometry (-4.74 D [95% CI -6.79 to -2.69]) and the maximum keratometry (-7.41 D [95% CI -9.64 to -5.19]), which remained significant one year postoperatively (-2.91 D [95% CI -5.29 to -0.53] and -5.80 D [-8.49 to -3.12]). Intra- and postoperative complications were observed in 3% and 9% of the patients, respectively. An estimated success rate of 75% to 85% was achieved by experienced surgeons at 5 to 8 years postoperatively. (4) Conclusions: Bowman layer transplantation may be an effective and safe treatment option in patients with advanced, progressive keratoconus. Additional multicenter prospective interventional studies are needed to confirm these preliminary findings."
The Effectiveness and Tolerability of Atropine Eye Drops for Myopia Control in Non-Asian Regions.,Journal of clinical medicine,2023 Mar 16,36983313,"Myopia is the most common ocular disorder worldwide with an increasing prevalence over the past few decades. It is a refractive error associated with excessive growth of the eyeball. Individuals with myopia, especially high myopia, are prone to develop sight-threatening complications. Currently, atropine is the only drug that is used to slow myopia progression in clinical practice. However, there are still areas of uncertainty such as treatment strategy, optimal concentration when considering risk-benefit ratio and active treatment period. Since the prevalence of myopia is much higher in Asian countries, most of the research on myopia control has been conducted in Asia. Data on the efficacy and tolerability to atropine eye drops in the non-Asian population remains limited. In this review, we summarize the results of published clinical trials on the effectiveness and tolerability of atropine eye drops for myopia control in non-Asian regions. The efficacy was evaluated by the mean change in spherical equivalent (SE) or axial length (AL). The tolerability of atropine eye drops was analyzed based on patients complains and adverse events. The results of this review suggest that 0.01% atropine eye drops are effective in non-Asian regions achieving less side effects compared to 0.5% concentration."
Clinical Significance of Corneal Striae in Thyroid Associated Orbitopathy.,Journal of clinical medicine,2023 Mar 15,36983285,"PURPOSE: To elucidate the clinical implications of corneal striae (CS) in thyroid associated orbitopathy (TAO) patients. METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, the presence of CS was confirmed after topical fluorescein staining on a slit lamp for consecutive treatment-naive TAO patients. Orbital parameters, including margin reflex distances, lagophthalmos, exophthalmos, intraocular pressure and radiological measurements, were compared between eyes with and without CS. The largest cross-sectional areas of each rectus muscle were measured by segmenting the T1-weighted (T1W) magnetic resonance images (MRI). The logistic regression analyses were used to evaluate the associations between CS and orbital parameters and rectus muscle measurements. RESULTS: Fifty-three consecutive TAO patients (presenting age 46.47 +/- 14.73 years, clinical activity score 1.77 +/- 1.25) who had unilateral CS were enrolled. In univariate analysis, both the degree of lagophthalmos and the area of the levator palpebrae superioris-superior rectus complex (LPS/SR) on T1W MRI were significantly larger in CS eyes compared to eyes without CS (p < 0.05). Multivariate analyses showed that CS in TAO patients were significantly associated with the degree of lagophthalmos (OR = 1.75, 95% CI: 1.18-2.61, p < 0.05) and LPS/SR area (OR = 19.27, 95% CI: 1.43-259.32, p < 0.05) but not with the other parameters. CS could predict LPS/SR enlargement and larger lagophthalmos in TAO (p < 0.05). The largest cross-sectional areas of LPS/SR and inferior rectus were positively correlated with clinical activity scores (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The presence of CS in TAO eye is significantly associated with LPS/SR enlargement and worse lagophthalmos. CS might be evaluated further as a potential ocular surface biomarker to identify upper lid and LPS/SR involvement in TAO."
