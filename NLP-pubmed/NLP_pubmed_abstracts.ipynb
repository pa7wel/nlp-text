Studies postulated that a distinct metabolic signature of DR exists and can be resolved from that of diabetes alone. Serum Semaphorin3A (Sema3A) levels have also been found to be correlated with the phenotypes of diabetic retinopathy. We aimed to analyze and identify serum metabolites and serum Sema3A levels that could be useful biomarkers of DR progression. This cross-sectional study included 45 type 2 diabetes (T2D) patients. Diabetic patients were divided into three groups based on the status of their complications: non-DR (NDR, n=15), non-proliferative DR (NPDR, n=15), and proliferative DR (PDR, n=15) groups. Serum metabolomic profiles of these patients were determined by using high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS), and serum Sema3A levels measured by ELISA. Metabolomics analysis revealed a set of metabolites that were altered in the serum of PDR patients as compared with NPDR and NDR groups. Among these metabolites total asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA) and Kynurenine were potential predictors of PDR patients. Significantly higher serum levels of Sema3A in PDR patients as compared with NPDR and NDR groups (p < 0.001), their serum levels were positively correlated with the central macular thickness (r= 0.952, p < 0.001) and negatively correlated with the superficial macular density (r=-0.952, p < 0.001). In conclusion, the metabolite signatures identified in this study and serum Sema3A levels could be proposed as biomarkers for DR development and progression in T2D patients. However, Sema3A was superior to metabolomics in the prediction of the severity of DR.', 'CI': ['Copyright(c) by the Egyptian Association of Immunologists.'], 'FAU': ['Mokhtar, Entsar R', 'Mahmoud, Doaa A', 'Ebrahim, Gamil E', 'Al Anany, Mona G', 'Seliem, Nora', 'Hassan, Marwa M'], 'AU': ['Mokhtar ER', 'Mahmoud DA', 'Ebrahim GE', 'Al Anany MG', 'Seliem N', 'Hassan MM'], 'AD': ['Department of Clinical Pathology, Faculty of Medicine (for Girls), Al-Azhar University, Cairo, Egypt.', 'Department of Ophthalmology, Faculty of Medicine (for Girls), Al-Azhar University, Cairo, Egypt.', 'Department of Chemistry of Flavor and Aroma, National Research Center, Dokki, Cairo, Egypt.', 'Department of Physiology, Faculty of Medicine (for Girls), Al-Azhar University, Cairo, Egypt.', 'Department of Medical Biochemistry, Faculty of Medicine (for Girls), Al-Azhar University, Cairo, Egypt.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine (for Girls), Al-Azhar University, Cairo, Egypt.'], 'LA': ['eng'], 'PT': ['Journal Article'], 'PL': 'Egypt', 'TA': 'Egypt J Immunol', 'JT': 'The Egyptian journal of immunology', 'JID': '9816016', 'SB': 'IM', 'EDAT': '2023/04/10 06:00', 'MHDA': '2023/04/10 06:00', 'CRDT': ['2023/04/09 11:26'], 'PHST': ['2023/04/09 11:26 [entrez]', '2023/04/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2023/04/10 06:00 [medline]'], 'PST': 'ppublish', 'SO': 'Egypt J Immunol. 2023 Apr;30(2):83-98.'}, {'PMID': '37030494', 'OWN': 'NLM', 'STAT': 'Publisher', 'LR': '20230408', 'IS': '1879-1891 (Electronic) 0002-9394 (Linking)', 'DP': '2023 Apr 6', 'TI': 'Benefits of a laser chorioretinal anastomosis plus ranibizumab vs ranibizumab alone for central retinal vein occlusion: 4-year results.', 'LID': 'S0002-9394(23)00150-2 [pii] 10.1016/j.ajo.2023.03.034 [doi]', 'AB': 'PURPOSE: Evaluate what clinical gains can be achieved over conventional treatment with ranibizumab alone for central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO) when causal pathology is additionally successfully addressed with a laser-induced chorio-retinal anastomosis (L-CRA).

METHODS: 58 patients with macular edema secondary to CRVO randomized 1:1 to receive either an L-CRA (29) or sham procedure (29) at baseline and then monthly intravitreal ranibizumab 0.5mg Outcomes (best corrected visual acuity (BCVA), central subfield thickness (CST), injection requirements) were monitored in the monthly pro re nata (PRN) ranibizumab phase from months 7-48. RESULTS: Injection requirements for those with a functioning L-CRA (24 of 29) during the monthly PRN period from 7-24 months, were mean (95% confidence interval [CI]) of 2.18 [1.57, 2.78] injections compared to 7.07 [6.08, 8.06] (p<0.0001) for control (ranibizumab alone).

DESIGN: An extended follow-up of Zhongshan Angle Closure Prevention (ZAP) study. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 889 Chinese patients aged 50 to 70 years with bilateral PACS. METHODS: Each patient received LPI in one randomly selected eye, with the fellow untreated eye serving as a control. Since the risk of glaucoma was low and acute angle closure (AAC) only occurred in rare cases, the follow-up was extended to 14 years despite substantial benefits of LPI reported after the 6-year visit. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome was incidence of PAC, a composite endpoint including peripheral anterior synechiae (PAS), intraocular pressure (IOP) > 24 mmHg, or AAC. RESULTS: During the 14 years, 390 LPI-treated eyes and 388 control eyes were lost to the follow-up. A total of 33 LPI-treated eyes and 105 control eyes reached primary endpoints (P <0.01). Within them, twelve eyes developed AAC or primary angle closure glaucoma (AAC: five control eyes and one LPI-treated eye; PACG: four control eyes and two LPI-treated eyes). The hazard ratio for progression to PAC was 0.31 (95% confidence interval, 0.21-0.46) in LPI-treated eyes compared with control eyes. At the 14-year visit, LPI-treated eyes had severer nuclear cataract, higher IOP, larger angle width and limbal anterior chamber depth (LACD) than control eyes. Higher IOP, shallower LACD, and central anterior chamber depth (CACD) were associated with an increased risk of developing endpoints in control eyes. In the treated group, eyes with higher IOP, shallower LACD, or less IOP elevation after dark room-prone provocative tests (DRPPT) were more likely to develop PAC after LPI. CONCLUSIONS: Despite a two-third decrease in PAC incidence after LPI, the cumulative risk of PAC was relatively low in the community-based PACS population over 14 years. Apart from IOP, IOP elevation after DRPPT, CACD, and LACD, more risk factors are needed to achieve precise prediction of PAC occurrence and guide clinical practice.', 'CI': ['Copyright (c) 2023.

We developed a new surgical technique of direct oral mucosal epithelial transplantation (OMET) to reconstruct severely damaged ocular surfaces in 2011. This study elaborates on the clinical efficacy of OMET. METHODS: A retrospective review of patients with severe ocular surface disorders who underwent OMET from 2011 to 2021 at the Department of Ophthalmology, Sir Run Run Shaw Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine was conducted. Patients who were followed up for at least 3 months postoperatively and had sufficient pre or postoperative records were included. Surgical efficacy was evaluated by comparing the best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), corneal transparency, neovascularization grade, and symblepharon grade. Additionally, postoperative ocular surface impression cytology was used to study the morphology of the newborn epithelial cells. RESULTS: Forty-eight patients (49 eyes; mean age: 42.55 +/- 12.40 years, range:12-66 years) were enrolled in the study. The etiology included chemical burns (30 eyes), thermal burns (16 eyes), explosive injuries (1 eye), Stevens-Johnson syndrome (1 eye), and multiple pterygiums (1 eye). The mean follow-up period was 25.97 +/- 22.99 months. Postoperatively, 29 eyes (59.18%) showed improved corneal transparency, 26 eyes (53.06%) had improved BCVA, 47 eyes (95.92%) had a stable epithelium until the final follow-up, 44 eyes (89.80%) had a reduced neovascularization grade. Of the 20 eyes with preoperative symblepharon, 15 (75%) were completely resolved, and five (25%) were partially resolved. Impression cytological studies showed no postoperative conjunctival invasion onto the corneal surface. CONCLUSIONS: OMET is a safe and effective surgical technique for reconstruction in severe ocular surface disorder by maintaining a stable epithelium and reducing the neovascularization and symblepharon grade.', 'CI': ['(c) 2023.

This study aimed to comprehensively evaluate the interaction of optic neuropathy's clinical course with systemic oxidative damage and antioxidant response dynamics in a large series. METHODS: This case-controlled clinical study included 33 non-arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (NAION) patients and 32 healthy individuals. Extensive systemic oxidation profiles were statistically compared between the two groups, and correlations between the clinical and biochemical data in the study group were analyzed. RESULTS: Vitamin E and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels were significantly higher in the study group. Significant correlations were observed in the analyses between clinical findings and oxidative stress parameters. Correlations between vitamin E and intraocular pressure (IOP), between B(12) and cup-to-disk ratio (c/d), between antioxidant glutathione and superoxide dismutase (SOD) enzyme systems, and between uric acid (UA) and age were found to be very significant. As significant correlations were found in either clinical and biochemical data or in oxidative stress parameters, correlations between vitamin E and cholesterol, MDA were found to be very significant. CONCLUSIONS: This study not only supplies significant information regarding oxidative damage and antioxidant response in NAION, but also points out the specific interactions of neuromodulators, like vitamin E, in intracellular signaling pathways and regulation mechanisms.

METHOD: Twenty eyes with large soft drusen and/or dPED AMD were included and treated with the LumiThera(R) ValedaTM Light Delivery System. All subjects underwent 2 treatments per week for 5 weeks. Outcome measures included best corrected visual acuity (BCVA), microperimetry- scotopic testing, drusen volume (DV), central drusen thickness (CDT), quality of life (QoL) score at baseline and month 6 (M6) follow up. Data of BCVA, DV and CDT was also recorded at week 5 (W5). RESULTS: BCVA significantly improved at M6 with a mean score gain of 5.5 letters (p = 0.007). Retinal sensitivity (RS) decreased by 0.1 dB (p=0.17). Mean fixation stability increased by 0.45 % (P=0.72). DV decreased by 0.11 mm3 (p=0.03). CDT was reduced by a mean of 17.05 microm (p=0.01). GA area increased by 0.06 mm2 (p=0.01) over a 6 months follow up, quality of life score increased by 3,07 points on average (p=0.05). One patient presented a dPED rupture at M6 after PBM treatment.

Leber's Hereditary Optic Neuropathy (LHON) as one of such optic neuropathy diseases that was first identified in 1871 and can be defined as a hereditary mitochondrial disease. LHON is associated with three mtDNA point mutations which are G11778A, T14484, and G3460A that affect the NADH dehydrogenase subunits of 4, 6, and 1, respectively. However, in most cases, only one point mutation is involved. Generally, in manifestation of the disease, there are no symptoms until the terminal dysfunction in the optic nerve is observed. Due to the mutations, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) dehydrogenase or complex I is absent and thus ATP production is stopped. This further causes the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and retina ganglion cells (RGC) apoptosis. Aside from the mutations, there are several environmental factors such as smoking and alcohol consumption that can be pointed out as the risk factors of LHON. Nowadays, gene therapy has been intensively studied for LHON treatment.

There is a great need for better-developed scales that comply with Rasch model requirements. METHODS: Prospective study including patients with DED. A series of focus groups were performed to determine the best items to be included. A Rasch modeling methodology was used to validate the Medellin Dry Eye Inventory (ME.Dry). After iterative analysis and scale modification, a final version of the scale was attained which complied with the Rasch analysis expectations. Correlation between the different subscales of the ME.Dry and the Ocular Surface Disease Index (OSDI) was evaluated through Spearman correlation. RESULTS: A total of 166 patients with DED were included. Rasch modeling demonstrated an excellent behavior for the ME.Dry, including four subscales: Symptoms, Triggers, Activity Limitation, and Emotional Compromise. Infit and Outfit parameters were all between 0.50 and 1.50, with excellent category utilization. Person and item separation and reliability were excellent for all subscales. There was a need for a category collapsing for the Emotional Compromise subscale. There was a strong correlation between the different subscales of the ME.Dry except for the Emotional Compromise subscale, which seems to be independent. CONCLUSION: The ME.Dry is a reliable scale, complying with the Rasch model expectations, that allows for a reliable measurement of quality of life compromise in patients with DED.

Since ADDE can be a source of long-term suffering and severe visual impairment, early identification and adequate treatment are imperative. Multiple etiologies can underlie ADDE, and it is critical to identify the underlying cause to not only improve the ocular health but also to improve the overall quality of life and well-being of affected individuals. This review discusses the various etiologies of ADDE, highlights a pathophysiology-based approach for evaluating underlying contributors, outlines various diagnostic tests, and reviews treatment options.

The PubMed database was used to conduct the literature search, which used the keywords \"intense pulsed light\" and \"dry eye disease\". After the authors evaluated the articles for relevancy, 49 articles were reviewed. In general, all treatment modalities were proven to be clinically effective in reducing dry eye (DE) signs and symptoms; however, the level of improvement and persistence of outcomes differed amongst them. Meta-analysis indicated significant improvement in the Ocular Surface Disease Index (OSDI) scores post-treatment with a standardized mean difference (SMD) = -1.63; confidence interval (CI): -2.42 to -0.84. Moreover, a meta-analysis indicated a significant improvement in tear break-up time (TBUT) test values with SMD = 1.77; CI: 0.49 to 3.05. Research suggests that additive therapies, such as meibomian gland expression (MGX), sodium hyaluronate eye drops, heated eye mask, warm compress, lid hygiene, lid margin scrub, eyelid massage, antibiotic drops, cyclosporine drops, omega-3 supplements, steroid drops, and warm compresses along with IPL, have been found to work in tandem for greater effectiveness; however, in clinical practice, its feasibility and cost-effectiveness have to be taken into consideration. Current findings suggest that IPL therapy is suitable when lifestyle modifications such as reducing or eliminating the use of contact lenses, lubricating eye drops/gels, and warm compresses/eye masks fail to improve signs and symptoms of DE. Moreover, patients with compliance issues have been shown to benefit well as the effects of IPL therapy is sustained for over several months. DED is a multifactorial disorder, and IPL therapy has been found to be safe and efficient in reducing its signs and symptoms of meibomian gland dysfunction (MGD)-related DE. Although the treatment protocol varies among authors, current findings suggest that IPL has a positive effect on the signs and symptoms of MGD-related DE. However, patients in the early stages can benefit more from IPL therapy. Moreover, IPL has a better maintenance impact when used in conjunction with other traditional therapies.

Due to overlapping biomarkers and symptoms, clinical differentiation of these subtypes could be difficult. However, it is unclear how the magnitude of diagnostic uncertainty varies across dementia spectra and demographic variables. We aimed to compare clinical diagnosis and post-mortem autopsy-confirmed pathological results to assess the clinical subtype diagnosis quality across these factors. METHODS: We studied data of 1,920 participants recorded by the National Alzheimer\\'s Coordinating Center from 2005 to 2019. Selection criteria included autopsy-based neuropathological assessments for AD and LBD, and the initial visit with Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) stage of normal, mild cognitive impairment, or mild dementia. Longitudinally, we analyzed the first visit at each subsequent CDR stage. This analysis included positive predictive values, specificity, sensitivity and false negative rates of clinical diagnosis, as well as disparities by sex, race, age, and education. If autopsy-confirmed AD and/or LBD was missed in the clinic, the alternative clinical diagnosis was analyzed. FINDINGS: In our findings, clinical diagnosis of AD+LBD had poor sensitivities. Over 61% of participants with autopsy-confirmed AD+LBD were diagnosed clinically as AD. Clinical diagnosis of AD had a low sensitivity at the early dementia stage and low specificities at all stages. Among participants diagnosed as AD in the clinic, over 32% had concurrent LBD neuropathology at autopsy. Among participants diagnosed as LBD, 32% to 54% revealed concurrent autopsy-confirmed AD pathology. When three subtypes were missed by clinicians, \"No cognitive impairment\" and \"primary progressive aphasia or behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia\" were the leading primary etiologic clinical diagnoses. With increasing dementia stages, the clinical diagnosis accuracy of black participants became significantly worse than other races, and diagnosis quality significantly improved for males but not females. DISCUSSION: These findings demonstrate that clinical diagnosis of AD, LBD, and AD+LBD are inaccurate and suffer from significant disparities on race and sex. They provide important implications for clinical management, anticipatory guidance, trial enrollment and applicability of potential therapies for AD, and promote research into better biomarker-based assessment of LBD pathology.', 'CI': ['Copyright (c) 2023 Wei, Masurkar and Razavian.'], 'FAU': ['Wei, Hui', 'Masurkar, Arjun V', 'Razavian, Narges'], 'AU': ['Wei H', 'Masurkar AV', 'Razavian N'], 'AD': ['Manning College of Information and Computer Sciences, University of Massachusetts Amherst, Amherst, MA, United States.', 'Department of Population Health, NYU Grossman School of Medicine, New York, NY, United States.', 'Center for Cognitive Neurology, Department of Neurology, NYU Grossman School of Medicine, New York, NY, United States.', 'Neuroscience Institute, NYU Grossman School of Medicine, New York, NY, United States.', 'Department of Population Health, NYU Grossman School of Medicine, New York, NY, United States.', 'Department of Radiology, NYU Grossman School of Medicine, New York, NY, United States.', 'Center for Data Science, New York University, New York, NY, United States.'], 'LA': ['eng'], 'PT': ['Journal Article'], 'DEP': '20230321', 'PL': 'Switzerland', 'TA': 'Front Aging Neurosci', 'JT': 'Frontiers in aging neuroscience', 'JID': '101525824', 'PMC': 'PMC10070837', 'OTO': ['NOTNLM'], 'OT': [\"Alzheimer's disease\", 'Lewy body disease', 'autopsy-confirmed results', 'clinical diagnosis accuracy', 'dementia stages', 'disparity'], 'COIS': ['HW and NR report grants from Leon Lowenstein Foundation.

DESIGN: A national 5-year register-based cohort study including 201 945 patients with diabetes. SUBJECTS: Patients with diabetes who had attended the Danish national screening program (2013-2018) for diabetic retinopathy (DR). METHODS: We used the first screening episode as the index date and included both eyes of patients with and without subsequent progression of PDR. Data were linked with various national health registries to investigate relevant clinical and demographic parameters. The International Clinical Retinopathy Disease Scale was used to classify DR, with no DR as level 0, mild DR as level 1, moderate DR as level 2, severe DR as level 3, and PDR as level 4. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Hazard ratios (HRs) for incident PDR for all relevant demographic and clinical parameters and 1-, 3-, and 5-year incidence rates of PDR according to baseline DR level. RESULTS: Progression to PDR within 5 years was identified in 2384 eyes of 1780 patients. Proliferative diabetic retinopathy progression rates from baseline DR level 3 at 1, 3 and 5 years were 3.6%, 10.9%, and 14.7%, respectively. The median number of visits was 3 (interquartile range, 1-4). Progression to PDR was predicted in a multivariable model by duration of diabetes (HR, 4.66 per 10 years; 95% confidence interval [CI], 4.05-5.37), type 1 diabetes (HR, 9.61; 95% CI, 8.01-11.53), a Charlson Comorbidity Index score of > 0 (score 1: HR, 4.62; 95% CI, 4.14-5.15; score 2: HR, 2.28; 95% CI, 1.90-2.74; score >/= 3: HR, 4.28; 95% CI, 3.54-5.17), use of insulin (HR, 5.33; 95% CI, 4.49-6.33), and use of antihypertensive medications (HR, 2.23; 95% CI, 1.90-2.61). CONCLUSIONS: In a 5-year longitudinal study of an entire screening nation, we found increased risk of PDR with increasing baseline DR levels, longer duration of diabetes, type 1 diabetes, systemic comorbidity, use of insulin, and blood pressure-lowering medications. Most interestingly, we found lower risk of progression from DR level 3 to PDR compared with that in previous studies.

DESIGN: Evaluation of diagnostic test or technology. PARTICIPANTS: Seventy-two participants with PCV enrolled in clinical studies at Singapore National Eye Center. METHODS: The dataset consisted of 2-dimensional (2-D) ICGA and 3-dimensional (3-D) SD-OCT images which were spatially registered and manually segmented by clinicians. A deep learning-based hybrid algorithm called PCV-Net was developed for automatic joint segmentation of biomarkers. The PCV-Net consisted of a 2-D segmentation branch for ICGA and 3-D segmentation branch for SD-OCT. We developed fusion attention modules to connect the 2-D and 3-D branches for effective use of the spatial correspondence between the imaging modalities by sharing learned features. We also used self-supervised pretraining and ensembling to further enhance the performance of the algorithm without the need for additional datasets. We compared the proposed PCV-Net to several alternative model variants. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The PCV-Net was evaluated based on the Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) of the segmentations and the Pearson's correlation and absolute difference of the clinical measurements obtained from the segmentations. Manual grading was used as the gold standard. RESULTS: The PCV-Net showed good performance compared to manual grading and alternative model variants based on both quantitative and qualitative analyses. Compared to the baseline variant, PCV-Net improved the DSC by 0.04 to 0.43 across the different biomarkers, increased the correlations, and decreased the absolute differences of clinical measurements of interest. Specifically, the largest average (mean +/- standard error) DSC improvement was for intraretinal fluid, from 0.02 +/- 0.00 (baseline variant) to 0.45 +/- 0.06 (PCV-Net). In general, improving trends were observed across the model variants as more technical specifications were added, demonstrating the importance of each aspect of the proposed method. CONCLUSION: The PCV-Net has the potential to aid clinicians in disease assessment and research to improve clinical understanding and management of PCV.

This study describes tumor-derived analyte concentrations from aqueous humor (AH) liquid biopsy and its use in clinical assays. DESIGN: Case series study. PARTICIPANTS: Sixty-two RB eyes from 55 children and 14 control eyes from 12 children from 4 medical centers. METHODS: This study included 128 RB AH samples including: diagnostic (DX) samples, samples from eyes undergoing treatment (TX), samples after completing treatment (END), and during bevacizumab injection for radiation therapy after completing RB treatment (BEV). Fourteen-control AH were analyzed for unprocessed analytes (double-stranded DNA [dsDNA], single-stranded DNA [ssDNA], micro-RNA [miRNA], RNA, and protein) with Qubit fluorescence assays. Double-stranded DNA from 2 RB AH samples underwent low-pass whole-genome sequencing to detect somatic copy number alterations. Logistic regression was used to predict disease burden given analyte concentrations. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Unprocessed analyte (dsDNA, ssDNA, miRNA, RNA and protein) concentrations. RESULTS: Results revealed dsDNA, ssDNA, miRNA, and proteins, but not RNA, were quantifiable in most samples (up to 98%) with Qubit fluorescence assays. Median dsDNA concentration was significantly higher in DX (3.08 ng/mul) compared to TX (0.18 ng/mul; P < 0.0001) at an order of 17 times greater and 20 times greater than END samples (0.15 ng/mul; P = 0.001). Using logistic regression, nucleic acid concentrations were useful in predicting higher versus lower RB disease burden. Retinoblastoma somatic copy number alterations were identified in a TX, but not in a BEV sample, indicating the correlation with RB activity. CONCLUSIONS: Aqueous humor liquid biopsy in RB is a high-yield source of dsDNA, ssDNA, miRNA, and protein. Diagnostic samples are most useful for RB 1 gene mutational analyses. Genomic analysis may be more informative of tumor activity status than quantification alone and can be performed even with smaller analyte concentrations obtained from TX samples.

METHODS: Sixty patients with moderate to severe TAO treated in Jingzhou Central Hospital from January 2022 to June 2022 were selected and enrtolled in this study. The subjects were divided into experimental group (n=30) and control group (n=30) based on the random number table method. Glucocorticoid pulse therapy was provided in the control group, while MMF was given in the experimental group on the basis of Control group. Clinical activity score (CAS), quality of life (QOL), visual acuity, eyelid fissure width, intraocular pressure, and degree of exophthalmos were observed at the time of admission and at the 12(th) week and 24(th) post-treatment weeks. We compared the immune function (TRAb, IL-6, and CD4+/CD8+) of the two groups pre-treatment and 24 weeks post-treatment, and evaluated the clinical therapeutic effect. RESULTS: The clinical effective rates at 12 and 24 weeks in the experimental group were higher (73.3% and 83.3%) than those in the control group (46.7% and 60.0%) (P <0.05). After 12 weeks of treatment, patients' CAS scores, and bilateral lid fissure width decreased and right eye visual acuity increased in the control group compared with those before treatment (P < 0.05); further, after 24 weeks of treatment, patients' QOL scores and bilateral visual acuity increased and CAS scores, bilateral lid fissure width and proptosis decreased compared with those before treatment, and patients' QOL scores, CAS scores and bilateral proptosis improved more than those at 12 weeks of treatment (P <0.05). Additionally, greater improvements were observed in the patients' QOL and CAS scores, and proptosis after 24-week treatment than after 12-week treatment (P<0.05). In the experimental group, the QOL score and binocular visual acuity increased, whereas the CAS score, intraocular pressure, lid width, and proptosis decreased after 12 weeks of treatment as compared to the values of these parameters in the pre-treatment period (P < 0.05); after 24 weeks of treatment, greater improvements were established in the ocular-related indexes improved compared to the pre-treatment period and after 12 weeks of treatment (P < 0.05). After 12 weeks of treatment, the patients in the experimental group had more considerable improvements in the right visual acuity, right intraocular pressure, and left lid fissure width than the control group (P < 0.05); at 24 weeks of treatment, patients in the experimental group had greater improvements in the QOL score, bilateral visual acuity, intraocular pressure, bilateral lid fissure width, and bilateral proptosis than the control group (P < 0.05). No significant differences were found in the values of TRAb, IL-6, and CD4+/CD8+ between the two groups before treatment (P>0.05); the values of TRAb, IL-6, and CD4+/CD8+ in the experimental group was significantly lower than those before treatment and in the control group after 24weeks of treatment. (P>0.05). No statistically significant difference was observed in the incidence of liver damage and menstrual disorders between the two groups during the 24 weeks of treatment (P>0.05).

Although there is great interest in harnessing this cytokine as a therapeutic in natural or engineered formats, the clinical potential of native IL-4 is limited by its instability and pleiotropic actions. Here, we design IL-4 cytokine mimetics (denoted Neo-4) based on a de novo engineered IL-2 mimetic scaffold and demonstrate that these cytokines can recapitulate physiological functions of IL-4 in cellular and animal models. In contrast with natural IL-4, Neo-4 is hyperstable and signals exclusively through the type I IL-4 receptor complex, providing previously inaccessible insights into differential IL-4 signaling through type I versus type II receptors. Because of their hyperstability, our computationally designed mimetics can directly incorporate into sophisticated biomaterials that require heat processing, such as three-dimensional-printed scaffolds. Neo-4 should be broadly useful for interrogating IL-4 biology, and the design workflow will inform targeted cytokine therapeutic development.', 'CI': ['(c) 2023.

(CLDEQ-8_IT). METHODS: The study was carried out in two phases. In the first phase, a cross-cultural adaptation of CLDEQ-8 to Italian was performed by forward and backward translation in sequence. In the second phase, a multi-centre study was conducted for the validation of the questionnaire. Validity CLDEQ-8_IT was evaluated against three gestalt questions: overall opinion of soft contact lenses (CLs), global self-assessments of eye sensitivity and eye dryness. Reliability was evaluated by test-retest assessment in a subgroup of subjects. Finally, the psychometric properties of CLDEQ-8_IT were explored by Rasch analysis. RESULTS: Two hundred and forty soft CL wearers, fluent Italian speakers (73 males and 167 females), between 18 and 70 years of age were enrolled. A significant correlation was found between CLDEQ-8_IT and each of the three Gestalt questions. The cutoff score of 12 points demonstrated the best balance between sensitivity and specificity in differentiating wearers grading their CLs as \"Excellent/Very good\" from those reporting their overall opinion as \"Good/Fair/Poor\". The Intraclass Correlation Coefficient between test and retest was 0.88 (95% CI: 0.81-0.92). Finally, infit and outfit statistics using Rasch analysis for the 8 items were in a good range, however Principal Components Analysis revealed a certain degree of multi-dimensionality of the instrument. Also, item 8 analysis could be computed after merging the last two response categories. CONCLUSION: The CLDEQ-8_IT showed very good validity and reliability in measuring symptoms of CL wearers, comparable to the original English language version. A cut-off of 12 was confirmed as yielding the best balance between sensitivity and specificity in detecting CL wearers who could benefit from clinical management of their CL-related symptoms. Collapsing of the response options 5 and 6 in the last item of questionnaire could optimise its functioning.', 'CI': ['Copyright (c) 2023.

Our aim in this study is to evaluate whether a foresight about the prognosis of patients with CSCR can be obtained by optical coherence tomography (OCT) findings. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients diagnosed with chronic CSCR at Fatih Sultan Mehmet Research and Training Hospital, Ophthalmology Department, were screened between January 2017 and September 2019, and 30 patients were included in the study. The anatomical and functional changes of the patients during the 6-month follow-up and the relationship between the OCT findings at baseline and the best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) in the sixth month were evaluated. RESULTS: All of the participants were treated with subthreshold micropulse laser therapy. BCVA increased significantly at first month and sixth month examinations compared to baseline, while the central macular thicknesses decreased significantly (p=0.01, p=0.00). Among the parameters examined in the baseline OCT, a positive correlation was found between the thickness of the outer nuclear layer (r=-0.520, p=0.003) and BCVA at sixth month. In addition, subretinal fluid density and the number of intra-subretinal hyperreflective dots negatively affected BCVA (r=0.371, p=0.044 and r=0.509, p=0.004). CONCLUSION: Outer nuclear layer thickness, subretinal fluid density and intra-subretinal hyperreflective dots were the OCT biomarkers related to sixth month BCVA.

The goal of this work is to determine if female enrollment in human clinical trials published in three high-impact journals from 2015 to 2019 is correlated with gender of first and/or senior authors. METHODS: Clinical trials published in the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA), The Lancet, and the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM) from January 1, 2015, to December 31, 2019, were reviewed. Trials were excluded for ongoing enrollment, sex-specific disease research, or author name without gender assignment. One-sample chi(2) pairwise comparisons and two-tailed proportion tests on the proportion of females between gender author pairings were done overall and for each subset analysis. RESULTS: 1,427 articles enrolled a total of 2,104,509 females and 2,616,981 males (44.6% vs. 55.4%, p </= 0.0001) in clinical trials.

Proportion of females enrolled decreased with the following first and senior author pairings: female-male (48.9%), male-female (48.6%), and male-male (40.5%, p </= 0.0001 compared to female-female authorship). Greater female enrollment in clinical trials with female-female compared to male-male authorship persisted in subset analyses by funding source, phase, randomization for study participants, drug and/or device trial, and geographic location. Female enrollment was higher in 3 surgical specialties: neurosurgery (all authors: 52%, p </= 0.01), ophthalmology (all authors: 53.6%, p </= 0.0001), and surgery (all authors: 54.4%, p </= 0.0001). The majority of surgical specialties did not publish trials with female-female authorship but when stratifying by author gender pairing, surgical oncology had the highest female enrollment with female-female authorship (98.4%, p </= 0.0001). CONCLUSION: Female authorship of clinical trial publications, specifically having both first and senior authors as female, was correlated with higher female enrollment in clinical trials when compared to male authorship and endured with multiple subset analyses.', 'CI': ['Published by Elsevier Inc.'], 'FAU': ['Chhaya, Vina Y', 'Binion, C Chase', 'Mulles, Shanen M', 'Tannhauser, Paige A', 'Aziz, Daniel Z', 'Greenwood, James D', 'Barlek, Mark H', 'Rouan, Jessica R', 'Wyatt, Thomas G', 'Kibbe, Melina R'], 'AU': ['Chhaya VY', 'Binion CC', 'Mulles SM', 'Tannhauser PA', 'Aziz DZ', 'Greenwood JD', 'Barlek MH', 'Rouan JR', 'Wyatt TG', 'Kibbe MR'], 'AD': ['Department of Surgery, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA 22903, USA.', 'Department of Biomedical Engineering, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA 22903, USA.', 'Department of Surgery, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA 22903, USA.', 'Department of Surgery, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA 22903, USA.', 'Department of Biomedical Engineering, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA 22903, USA.', 'Department of Surgery, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA 22903, USA.', 'Department of Surgery, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA 22903, USA; Department of Surgery, Allegheny Health Network, Pittsburgh, PA 15212, USA.', 'Department of Surgery, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC 27599, USA.', 'Department of Surgery, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA 22903, USA; Department of Surgery, Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center, Lubbock, TX 79410, USA.', 'Department of Surgery, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA 22903, USA; Department of Biomedical Engineering, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA 22903, USA.

The development of drugs that prevent or ameliorate fibrosis in nAMD requires that it is accurately detected and quantified with reliable endpoints and identification of robust biomarkers. Achievement of such an aim is currently challenging due to the lack of a consensus definition of fibrosis in nAMD. As a first step towards the establishment of a clear definition of fibrosis, we provide an extensive overview of the imaging modalities and criteria used to characterize fibrosis in nAMD. We observed variety in the selection of individual and combinations of imaging modalities, and criteria for detection. We also observed heterogeneity in classification systems and severity scales for fibrosis. The most commonly used imaging modalities were color fundus photography (CFP), fluorescence angiography (FA) and optical coherence tomography (OCT). A multimodal approach was frequently utilized. Our review suggests that OCT offers a more detailed, objective and sensitive characterization than CFP/FA. Thus, we recommend it as a primary modality for fibrosis evaluation. This review provides a basis for future discussions to reach a consensus definition using standardized terms based on a detailed characterization of fibrosis, its presence and evolution, and taking into consideration impact on visual function.

However, neuropathological processes underlying these retinal structural changes and its clinical correlates are yet to be known. Here, we aim to investigate the clinical and biological correlates of OCT findings in schizophrenia. 50 schizophrenia patients and 40 healthy controls were recruited. Retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL), ganglion cell layer (GCL), inner plexiform layer (IPL), and macular and choroidal thicknesses were recorded. A comprehensive battery of neuropsychological tests was applied. Fasting glucose, triglycerides and HDL-cholesterol levels, TNF-alpha, IL-1beta and IL-6 levels were measured. Right IPL was significantly thinner in patients than the controls after controlling for various confounders (F = 5.42, p = .02). Higher IL-6, IL-1beta, and TNF-alpha levels were associated with decreased left macular thickness (r =  - 0.26, p = .027, r =  - 0.30, p = 0.012, and r =  - 0.24, p = .046, respectively) and higher IL-6 was associated with thinning of right IPL (r =  - 0.27, p = 0.023) and left choroid (r =  - 0.23, p = .044) in the overall sample. Thinning of right IPL and left macula were also associated with worse executive functioning (r = 0.37, p = 0.004 and r = 0.33, p = 0.009) and attention (r = 0.31, p = 0.018 and r = 0.30, p = 0.025). In patients with schizophrenia, IPL thinning was associated with increased BMI (r =  - 0.44, p = 0.009) and decreased HDL levels (r = 0.43, p = 0.021). Decreased TNF-alpha level was related to IPL thinning, especially in the left eye (r = 0.40, p = 0.022). These findings support the hypothesis that OCT might provide the opportunity to establish an accessible and non-invasive probe of brain pathology in schizophrenia and related disorders.

The aim of the current study was to report on the incidence and clinical characteristics of children presenting with large clear cornea that do not suffer glaucoma. METHODS: A retrospective chart review of children presenting with large clear cornea to the pediatric ophthalmology unit of the ophthalmology department of Alexandria Main University Hospital in the period from March 2011 to December 2020 was conducted. A large clear cornea was defined as a horizontal white-to-white corneal diameter (as measured by calipers) greater than 12 mm. Glaucoma was diagnosed according to the childhood glaucoma research network (CGRN) criteria and the axial length was used to filter out eyes with large clear corneas due to congenital high myopia. RESULTS: Out of 120 eyes of 91 (58 males) children a total of 76 eyes of 67 (41 males) children were diagnosed with glaucoma and 44 eyes of 24 (17 males) children (36.7%) did not suffer glaucoma. Out of these, 30 eyes were classified as myopia and 14 eyes as congenital megalocornea.

We found that females with EEM showed a significantly higher rate of persistence of photosensitivity and eye closure sensitivity at the last visit, along with a higher prevalence of migraine with aura, whereas males with EEM presented a higher rate of borderline intellectual functioning/intellectual disability. In female patients, multivariable logistic regression analysis revealed age at epilepsy onset, eyelid myoclonia status epilepticus, psychiatric comorbidities and catamenial seizures as significant predictors of drug resistance. In male patients, a history of febrile seizures was the only predictor of drug resistance.

Manifestations of RTT typically include loss of purposeful hand skills, gait and motor abnormalities, loss of spoken language, stereotypic hand movements, epilepsy, and autonomic dysfunction. Patients with RTT have a higher incidence of sudden death than the general population. Literature data indicate an uncoupling between measures of breathing and heart rate control that could offer insight into the mechanisms that lead to greater vulnerability to sudden death. Understanding the neural mechanisms of autonomic dysfunction and its correlation with sudden death is essential for patient care. Experimental evidence for increased sympathetic or reduced vagal modulation to the heart has spurred efforts to develop quantitative markers of cardiac autonomic profile. Heart rate variability (HRV) has emerged as a valuable non-invasive test to estimate the modulation of sympathetic and parasympathetic branches of the autonomic nervous system (ANS) to the heart. This review aims to provide an overview of the current knowledge on autonomic dysfunction and, in particular, to assess whether HRV parameters can help unravel patterns of cardiac autonomic dysregulation in patients with RTT. Literature data show reduced global HRV (total spectral power and R-R mean) and a shifted sympatho-vagal balance toward sympathetic predominance and vagal withdrawal in patients with RTT compared to controls. In addition, correlations between HRV and genotype and phenotype features or neurochemical changes were investigated. The data reported in this review suggest an important impairment in sympatho-vagal balance, supporting possible future research scenarios, targeting ANS.', 'CI': ['Copyright (c) 2023 Cordani, Tobaldini, Rodrigues, Giambersio, Veneruso, Chiarella,', 'Disma, De Grandis, Toschi-Dias, Furlan, Carandina, Prato, Nobili and Montano.'], 'FAU': ['Cordani, Ramona', 'Tobaldini, Eleonora', 'Rodrigues, Gabriel Dias', 'Giambersio, Donatella', 'Veneruso, Marco', 'Chiarella, Lorenzo', 'Disma, Nicola', 'De Grandis, Elisa', 'Toschi-Dias, Edgar', 'Furlan, Ludovico', 'Carandina, Angelica', 'Prato, Giulia', 'Nobili, Lino', 'Montano, Nicola'], 'AU': ['Cordani R', 'Tobaldini E', 'Rodrigues GD', 'Giambersio D', 'Veneruso M', 'Chiarella L', 'Disma N', 'De Grandis E', 'Toschi-Dias E', 'Furlan L', 'Carandina A', 'Prato G', 'Nobili L', 'Montano N'], 'AD': ['Department of Neuroscience, Rehabilitation, Ophthalmology, Genetics, Maternal and Child Health, University of Genoa, Genoa, Italy.', 'Unit for Research & Innovation in Anesthesia, IRCCS Istituto Giannina Gaslini, Genova, Italy.', 'Department of Clinical Sciences and Community Health, University of Milan, Milan, Italy.', \"Department of Internal Medicine, Fondazione IRCCS Ca' Granda, Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico, Milan, Italy.\", 'Department of Clinical Sciences and Community Health, University of Milan, Milan, Italy.', 'Child Neuropsychiatry Unit, IRCCS Istituto Giannina Gaslini, Genova, Italy.', 'Department of Basic Medical Sciences, Neuroscience and Sense Organs, University of Bari \"Aldo Moro\", Bari, Italy.', 'Department of Neuroscience, Rehabilitation, Ophthalmology, Genetics, Maternal and Child Health, University of Genoa, Genoa, Italy.', 'Child Neuropsychiatry Unit, IRCCS Istituto Giannina Gaslini, Genova, Italy.', 'Department of Neuroscience, Rehabilitation, Ophthalmology, Genetics, Maternal and Child Health, University of Genoa, Genoa, Italy.', 'Unit for Research & Innovation in Anesthesia, IRCCS Istituto Giannina Gaslini, Genova, Italy.', 'Department of Neuroscience, Rehabilitation, Ophthalmology, Genetics, Maternal and Child Health, University of Genoa, Genoa, Italy.', 'Child Neuropsychiatry Unit, IRCCS Istituto Giannina Gaslini, Genova, Italy.', 'Health Psychology Program, Methodist University of Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'Psychology, Development and Public Policy Program, Catholic University of Santos, Sao Paulo, Brazil.', \"Department of Internal Medicine, Fondazione IRCCS Ca' Granda, Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico, Milan, Italy.\", 'Department of Clinical Sciences and Community Health, University of Milan, Milan, Italy.', \"Department of Internal Medicine, Fondazione IRCCS Ca' Granda, Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico, Milan, Italy.\", 'Child Neuropsychiatry Unit, IRCCS Istituto Giannina Gaslini, Genova, Italy.', 'Department of Neuroscience, Rehabilitation, Ophthalmology, Genetics, Maternal and Child Health, University of Genoa, Genoa, Italy.', 'Child Neuropsychiatry Unit, IRCCS Istituto Giannina Gaslini, Genova, Italy.', 'Department of Clinical Sciences and Community Health, University of Milan, Milan, Italy.', \"Department of Internal Medicine, Fondazione IRCCS Ca' Granda, Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico, Milan, Italy.\"], 'LA': ['eng'], 'PT': ['Journal Article', 'Review'], 'DEP': '20230320', 'PL': 'Switzerland', 'TA': 'Front Neurosci', 'JT': 'Frontiers in neuroscience', 'JID': '101478481', 'PMC': 'PMC10067665', 'OTO': ['NOTNLM'], 'OT': ['Rett syndrome (RTT)', 'autonomic nervous system', 'cardiac autonomic control', 'dysautonomia', 'heart rate variability (HRV)', 'methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 (MECP2)'], 'COIS': ['The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any', 'commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential', 'conflict of interest.'], 'EDAT': '2023/04/07 06:00', 'MHDA': '2023/04/07 06:01', 'CRDT': ['2023/04/06 02:16'], 'PHST': ['2022/09/19 00:00 [received]', '2023/02/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2023/04/07 06:01 [medline]', '2023/04/06 02:16 [entrez]', '2023/04/07 06:00 [pubmed]'], 'AID': ['10.3389/fnins.2023.1048278 [doi]'], 'PST': 'epublish', 'SO': 'Front Neurosci. 2023 Mar 20;17:1048278. doi: 10.3389/fnins.2023.1048278. eCollection 2023.'}, {'PMID': '37021010', 'OWN': 'NLM', 'STAT': 'PubMed-not-MEDLINE', 'LR': '20230407', 'IS': '1664-8021 (Print) 1664-8021 (Electronic) 1664-8021 (Linking)', 'VI': '14', 'DP': '2023', 'TI': 'Congenital insensitivity to pain associated with PRDM12 mutation: Two case reports and a literature review.', 'PG': '1139161', 'LID': '10.3389/fgene.2023.1139161 [doi] 1139161', 'AB': 'Background: PRDM12 is a newly discovered gene responsible for congenital insensitivity to pain (CIP). Its clinical manifestations are various and not widely known. Methods: The clinical data of two infants diagnosed with CIP associated with PRDM12 mutation were collected. A literature review was performed, and the clinical characteristics of 20 cases diagnosed with a mutation of PRDM12 were summarized and analyzed. Results: Two patients had pain insensitivity, tongue and lip defects, and corneal ulcers. The genomic analysis results showed that variants of PRDM12 were detected in the two families. The case 1 patient carried heterozygous variations of c.682+1G > A and c.502C > T (p.R168C), which were inherited from her father and mother, respectively. We enrolled 22 patients diagnosed with CIP through a literature review together with our cases. There were 16 male (72.7%) and 6 female (27.3%) patients. The age of onset ranged from 6 months to 57 years. The prevalence of clinic manifestation was 14 cases with insensitivity to pain (63.6%), 19 cases with self-mutilation behaviors (86.4%), 11 cases with tongue and lip defects (50%), 5 cases with mid-facial lesions (22.7%), 6 cases with distal phalanx injury (27.3%), 11 cases of recurrent infection (50%), 3 cases (13.6%) with anhidrosis, and 5 cases (22.7%) with global developmental delay.

Therefore, adjustments to high school curricula may aid in reducing the prevalence of myopia among adolescents. PURPOSE: To investigate the prevalence of myopia among 15- to 18-year-old adolescents in Tianjin, China, and to evaluate the impact of different educational schedules on the prevalence of myopia among high school students. METHODS: This is a school-based epidemiological study with a cross-sectional design. Ocular biological parameters and noncycloplegic photorefraction were examined using optical biometry devices and photoscreener devices. Each student's spherical equivalent (SE) and ocular biometry were recorded, and the prevalence of myopia was calculated. RESULTS: A total of 2,867 participants (1,519 males and 1,348 females) were tested for non-cycloplegic refraction, axial length (AL), central corneal thickness (CCT), anterior chamber depth (ACD) and lens thickness (LT). In this research, the overall prevalence of myopia was 81.6%, with high myopia accounting for 11.8%. Myopia prevalence was substantially higher in general high schools than in vocational high schools, with 86.1 and 70.1%, respectively. There were no significant differences in the prevalence of myopia (p = 0.744) or high myopia (p = 0.851) across the three vocational school years. In the general high school, however, there was an increase of 4.6% (p < 0.05) in myopia prevalence between year 10 and year12. CONCLUSION: Comparing vocational and standard high school students, there are considerable disparities in prevalence of myopia, spherical equivalent, and ocular biological parameters. The prevalence of myopia and high myopia increased among standard high school students, but remained relatively consistent among students in vocational schools.\", 'CI': ['Copyright (c) 2023 Liu, Meng, Wang, Wang, Xue, Hao and Zhang.'], 'FAU': ['Liu, Yang', 'Meng, Dexin', 'Wang, Yun', 'Wang, Xuechun', 'Xue, Caihong', 'Hao, Rui', 'Zhang, Wei'], 'AU': ['Liu Y', 'Meng D', 'Wang Y', 'Wang X', 'Xue C', 'Hao R', 'Zhang W'], 'AD': ['Tianjin Eye Hospital, Tianjin Key Lab of Ophthalmology and Visual Science, Nankai University Affiliated Eye Hospital, Clinical College of Ophthalmology Tianjin Medical University, Tianjin, China.', 'Department of Ophthalmology, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Harbin Medical University, Harbin, China.', \"Tianjin Occupational Diseases Precaution and Therapeutic Hospital (Tianjin Workers' Hospital), Tianjin, China.\", 'Tianjin Eye Hospital, Tianjin Key Lab of Ophthalmology and Visual Science, Nankai University Affiliated Eye Hospital, Clinical College of Ophthalmology Tianjin Medical University, Tianjin, China.', 'Tianjin Eye Hospital, Tianjin Key Lab of Ophthalmology and Visual Science, Nankai University Affiliated Eye Hospital, Clinical College of Ophthalmology Tianjin Medical University, Tianjin, China.', 'Tianjin Eye Hospital, Tianjin Key Lab of Ophthalmology and Visual Science, Nankai University Affiliated Eye Hospital, Clinical College of Ophthalmology Tianjin Medical University, Tianjin, China.', 'Tianjin Eye Hospital, Tianjin Key Lab of Ophthalmology and Visual Science, Nankai University Affiliated Eye Hospital, Clinical College of Ophthalmology Tianjin Medical University, Tianjin, China.'], 'LA': ['eng'], 'PT': ['Journal Article'], 'DEP': '20230320', 'PL': 'Switzerland', 'TA': 'Front Public Health', 'JT': 'Frontiers in public health', 'JID': '101616579', 'SB': 'IM', 'MH': ['Male', 'Female', 'Adolescent', 'Humans', 'Prevalence', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', '*Eye', '*Myopia/epidemiology', 'Refraction, Ocular'], 'PMC': 'PMC10067628', 'OTO': ['NOTNLM'], 'OT': ['educational schedule', 'high school students', 'myopia', 'ocular biometry', 'prevalence'], 'COIS': ['The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any', 'commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential', 'conflict of interest.'], 'EDAT': '2023/04/07 06:00', 'MHDA': '2023/04/07 10:18', 'CRDT': ['2023/04/06 02:10'], 'PHST': ['2022/11/16 00:00 [received]', '2023/03/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2023/04/07 10:18 [medline]', '2023/04/06 02:10 [entrez]', '2023/04/07 06:00 [pubmed]'], 'AID': ['10.3389/fpubh.2023.1100437 [doi]'], 'PST': 'epublish', 'SO': 'Front Public Health. 2023 Mar 20;11:1100437. doi: 10.3389/fpubh.2023.1100437. eCollection 2023.'}, {'PMID': '37020797', 'OWN': 'NLM', 'STAT': 'PubMed-not-MEDLINE', 'LR': '20230407', 'IS': '1178-6973 (Print) 1178-6973 (Electronic) 1178-6973 (Linking)', 'VI': '16', 'DP': '2023', 'TI': 'Clinical Observation of Low-Temperature Plasma Ablation Combined with Drug Therapy in the Treatment of Fungal Keratitis.', 'PG': '1895-1904', 'LID': '10.2147/IDR.S399715 [doi]', 'AB': 'OBJECTIVE: To observe the efficacy and prognosis of low-temperature plasma ablation + drug therapy in the treatment of fungal corneal ulcers. METHODS: The present paper presents a retrospective clinical study with a subject base of 34 eyes. Patients with a fungal corneal ulcer who visited the Affiliated Eye Hospital of Nanchang University between August 2019 and December 2021 were selected as the study participants. They were found to have highly reflective fungal hyphae in the corneal stroma layer via confocal microscope examination, which were revealed to be positive on etiology examination, with the ulcer and infiltration depths </=1/2 of the corneal thickness. The efficacy and prognosis were observed after treatment with low-temperature plasma ablation + drug therapy. RESULTS: A total of 34 cases (34 eyes) had clinical manifestations of corneal infiltration and corneal ulcer formation, with a corneal lesion diameter of 1.31-8.64 mm (average = 4.79 +/- 2.03 mm). The average healing time of corneal ulcers was 6.2 +/- 1.7 days. Among a total of 34 cases (34 eyes) in patients with fungal keratitis, the infection was controlled and the ulcers gradually healed after treatment with low-temperature plasma system + drug therapy in a total of 30 cases (30 eyes, 88%). A total of three cases (3 eyes, 9%) exhibited no clear improvement after the treatment, and the patients underwent conjunctival flap covering surgery. One case (one eye, 3%) exhibited no clear improvement after further treatment, with the patient experiencing corneal perforation and ultimately undergoing penetrating keratoplasty.

METHODS: Articles and reviews related to teaching reforms in physiology published between January 1, 2012, and December 31, 2021, were obtained from the Web of Science Core Collection. Two Scientometric software applications (CiteSpace 5.7 and VOSviewer 1.6.15) were used to perform bibliometric and knowledge-map analysis, generate network maps, and identify research trends and top keywords, authors, co-cited authors, institutions, countries, journals, and references. RESULTS: The search identified a total of 2,882 papers in 466 academic journals by 13,895 authors from 4,072 organizations in 67 countries/regions. Physiology teaching reform-related publications increased rapidly over time. Arango-Lasprilla and Rivera published the most papers, while Moseley had the most co-citations. Active collaborations among physiology researchers were noted. Advances in Physiology Education published the most papers on physiology teaching reforms and was also the top co-cited journal in the Medicine/Medical/Clinical, Psychology/Education/Health, and Neurology/Sports/Ophthalmology fields. The United States and University of California published the most physiology teaching publications in the search criteria. Ten references (research articles and reviews) on mechanisms and diseases were identified as the knowledge base. The mainstream research directions were education, Alzheimer's disease, performance, physiology, and risk factors. Mental health and emotion regulation are increasing in significance and may become new hotspots. The research trend to move from the field of pain pathogenesis to the field of neuropsychiatry has become increasingly clear. This tendency away from peripheral system-based disorders to central system-based orders is inextricably linked to further developments in physiological understanding of the brain. CONCLUSION: This study analyzed the research hot spots and frontiers of teaching reforms on in physiology using bibliometric and visual methods. Based on the results, rehabilitation, neurosciences, and infectious disease are hot topics in physiology. In particular, the pathogenesis of neurological diseases, treatment strategies, and technology updates have gradually become research hotspots. We predict that this trend is closely related to the implementation of brain research programs in various countries. These findings provide helpful references for scholars focusing on physiology education.\", 'CI': ['Copyright (c) 2023 Xu, Sun, Zhao and Ma.'], 'FAU': ['Xu, Jia', 'Sun, Shimeng', 'Zhao, Yadong', 'Ma, Qing'], 'AU': ['Xu J', 'Sun S', 'Zhao Y', 'Ma Q'], 'AD': ['Department of Physiology and Pharmacology, NBU Health Science Center, Ningbo University, Ningbo, Zhejiang, China.', 'The First Affiliated Hospital of Ningbo University, Ningbo, Zhejiang, China.', 'Department of Physiology and Pharmacology, NBU Health Science Center, Ningbo University, Ningbo, Zhejiang, China.', 'Department of Physiology and Pharmacology, NBU Health Science Center, Ningbo University, Ningbo, Zhejiang, China.', 'Department of Physiology and Pharmacology, NBU Health Science Center, Ningbo University, Ningbo, Zhejiang, China.', 'The First Affiliated Hospital of Ningbo University, Ningbo, Zhejiang, China.'], 'LA': ['eng'], 'PT': ['Journal Article'], 'DEP': '20230320', 'PL': 'Switzerland', 'TA': 'Front Med (Lausanne)', 'JT': 'Frontiers in medicine', 'JID': '101648047', 'PMC': 'PMC10067749', 'OTO': ['NOTNLM'], 'OT': ['bibliometrics', 'knowledge-map', 'physiology', 'teaching reform', 'visualization'], 'COIS': ['The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any', 'commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential', 'conflict of interest.'], 'EDAT': '2023/04/07 06:00', 'MHDA': '2023/04/07 06:01', 'CRDT': ['2023/04/06 02:07'], 'PHST': ['2022/09/21 00:00 [received]', '2023/02/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2023/04/07 06:01 [medline]', '2023/04/06 02:07 [entrez]', '2023/04/07 06:00 [pubmed]'], 'AID': ['10.3389/fmed.2023.1031713 [doi]'], 'PST': 'epublish', 'SO': 'Front Med (Lausanne). 2023 Mar 20;10:1031713. doi: 10.3389/fmed.2023.1031713. eCollection 2023.'}, {'PMID': '37020561', 'OWN': 'NLM', 'STAT': 'MEDLINE', 'DCOM': '20230407', 'LR': '20230407', 'IS': '1664-3224 (Electronic) 1664-3224 (Linking)', 'VI': '14', 'DP': '2023', 'TI': 'Characterization of dysbiosis of the conjunctival microbiome and nasal microbiome associated with allergic rhinoconjunctivitis and allergic rhinitis.', 'PG': '1079154', 'LID': '10.3389/fimmu.2023.1079154 [doi] 1079154', 'AB': 'BACKGROUND: Allergic rhinoconjunctivitis (ARC) and allergic rhinitis (AR) are prevalent allergic diseases. People are becoming increasingly aware of the impact of microbial disorders on host immunity and allergic diseases. Studies have demonstrated an association between allergic diseases and the microbiome, but much remains unknown. We assessed changes in the conjunctival microbiome and nasal microbiome in patients with ARC or AR. METHODS: Conjunctival swabs and nasal swabs were collected from each participant for 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing. Bacterial communities were analyzed. RESULTS: Forty patients with ARC, 20 patients suffering from AR, and 34 healthy controls (HCs) were recruited. This study found the abundance of conjunctival microbiome in patients with ARC or AR was significantly lower than that in HCs. The diversity of conjunctival microbiome in patients with AR was significantly lower than those in the other two groups. There is no significant difference in abundance of nasal microbiome between the three groups. The diversities of nasal microbiome in patients with ARC or AR were significantly lower than that in HCs. We found significant differences in microbiota compositions in patients with ARC or AR compared with those in HCs. However, no significant difference in microbiota compositions was found between patients with ARC and patients with AR. Microbiome functions in the ARC group and AR group were also altered compared with HCs. CONCLUSIONS: We revealed changes in the composition and function of the conjunctival microbiome and nasal microbiome of patients with ARC or AR, which suggests that there is a relationship between allergic conditions and the local microbiome.', 'CI': ['Copyright (c) 2023 Wang, Li, Gu and Fu.'], 'FAU': ['Wang, Yuan', 'Li, Xuan', 'Gu, Shuntong', 'Fu, Junhong'], 'AU': ['Wang Y', 'Li X', 'Gu S', 'Fu J'], 'AD': ['Clinical College of Ophthalmology, Tianjin Medical University, Tianjin, China.', 'Tianjin Eye Hospital, Tianjin Key Laboratory of Ophthalmology and Visual Science, Tianjin Eye Institute, Tianjin, China.', 'Department of Otolaryngology-Head & Neck Surgery, Tianjin TEDA Hospital, Tianjin, China.', 'Clinical College of Ophthalmology, Tianjin Medical University, Tianjin, China.', 'Tianjin Eye Hospital, Tianjin Key Laboratory of Ophthalmology and Visual Science, Tianjin Eye Institute, Tianjin, China.', 'Nankai University Affiliated Eye Hospital, Nankai University, Tianjin, China.', 'Department of General Surgery, Tianjin Fifth Central Hospital, Tianjin, China.', 'Department of Vascular Surgery, Tianjin Medical University General Hospital, Tianjin, China.', 'Department of Ophthalmology, Tianjin TEDA Hospital, Tianjin, China.'], 'LA': ['eng'], 'PT': ['Journal Article'], 'DEP': '20230320', 'PL': 'Switzerland', 'TA': 'Front Immunol', 'JT': 'Frontiers in immunology', 'JID': '101560960', 'RN': ['0 (RNA, Ribosomal, 16S)'], 'SB': 'IM', 'MH': ['Humans', 'Dysbiosis', 'RNA, Ribosomal, 16S/genetics', '*Rhinitis, Allergic/microbiology', 'Nose', '*Microbiota', '*Conjunctivitis'], 'PMC': 'PMC10068870', 'OTO': ['NOTNLM'], 'OT': ['16s rRNA amplicon sequencing', 'allergic rhinitis', 'allergic rhinoconjunctivitis', 'conjunctival', 'microbiome', 'nasal'], 'COIS': ['The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any', 'commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential', 'conflict of interest.'], 'EDAT': '2023/04/07 06:00', 'MHDA': '2023/04/07 10:18', 'CRDT': ['2023/04/06 02:05'], 'PHST': ['2022/10/25 00:00 [received]', '2023/03/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2023/04/07 10:18 [medline]', '2023/04/06 02:05 [entrez]', '2023/04/07 06:00 [pubmed]'], 'AID': ['10.3389/fimmu.2023.1079154 [doi]'], 'PST': 'epublish', 'SO': 'Front Immunol. 2023 Mar 20;14:1079154. doi: 10.3389/fimmu.2023.1079154. eCollection 2023.'}, {'PMID': '37020551', 'OWN': 'NLM', 'STAT': 'MEDLINE', 'DCOM': '20230407', 'LR': '20230407', 'IS': '1664-3224 (Electronic) 1664-3224 (Linking)', 'VI': '14', 'DP': '2023', 'TI': 'Ankylosing spondylitis and glaucoma in European population: A Mendelian randomization study.', 'PG': '1120742', 'LID': '10.3389/fimmu.2023.1120742 [doi] 1120742', 'AB': \"BACKGROUND: The relationship between ankylosing spondylitis (AS) and glaucoma in the European population remains unclear. In the present study, we applied a two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) method to investigate their causal relationship. METHODS: MR analysis was conducted to validate the causal associations between AS with glaucoma using summary statistics from the genome-wide association studies of AS (9,069 cases and 13,578 control subjects) and glaucoma (8,591 cases and 210,201 control subjects). The inverse variance weighting method was performed to evaluate the causal relationship. The MR-Egger regression approach was applied to assess pleiotropy, while Cochran's Q test was used to analyze heterogeneity. Subgroup analysis was performed according to primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) and primary angle-closure glaucoma (PACG). RESULTS: The results of the MR study reveal a risk-increasing causal relationship between AS and glaucoma among European populations (OR = 1.35, 95%CI = 1.16-1.57, P = 8.81 x 10(-5)).

The lateral septum (LS) is thought to control of depression, however, the cellular and circuit substrates are largely unknown. Here, we identified a subpopulation of LS GABAergic adenosine A(2A) receptors (A(2A)R)-positive neurons mediating depressive symptoms via direct projects to the lateral habenula (LHb) and the dorsomedial hypothalamus (DMH). Activation of A(2A)R in the LS augmented the spiking frequency of A(2A)R-positive neurons leading to a decreased activation of surrounding neurons and the bi-directional manipulation of LS-A(2A)R activity demonstrated that LS-A(2A)Rs are necessary and sufficient to trigger depressive phenotypes. Thus, the optogenetic modulation (stimulation or inhibition) of LS-A(2A)R-positive neuronal activity or LS-A(2A)R-positive neurons projection terminals to the LHb or DMH, phenocopied depressive behaviors. Moreover, A(2A)R are upregulated in the LS in two male mouse models of repeated stress-induced depression.

METHOD: An observational study based on real-world data source from the National Cataract Recovery Surgery Information Registration and Reporting System. RESULTS: A total of 14 157 463 original records were reported from 1 July 2009 to 31 December 2018. The factors that influenced the 3-day postsurgical best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), the primary outcome, were analysed by logistic regression analysis. We found that a history of hypertension (OR=0.916) or diabetes (OR=0.912), presurgical pupil abnormality (OR=0.571) and high intraocular pressure (OR=0.578) were harmful to the postsurgical BCVA improvement (BCVA >/=6/20), while male sex (OR=1.113), better presurgical BCVA level (OR=5.996 for >/=6/12-<6/7.5 and OR=2.610 for >6/60-<6/12 taken </=6/60 as reference), age-related cataract (OR=1.825) and intraocular lens implantation (OR=1.886) were statistically beneficial to the postsurgical BCVA improvement. Compared with extracapsular cataract extraction (ECCE) with large incision, the ECCE with small incision (OR value=1.810) and the phacoemulsification (OR=1.420) significantly improved the benefit probability. CONCLUSION: ECCE with small incision has comparable effects on postsurgical BCVA improvement of phacoemulsification.

By far, little is known about the effect of DNA 5-hmC and the TET family on the development of Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada (VKH) disease. In this study, we discovered that the global DNA 5-hmC level and the TET activity were elevated in association with the up-regulated expression of TET2 at both mRNA and protein levels in CD4(+)T cells from active VKH patients compared to healthy controls. Integrated analysis of DNA 5-hmC pattern and transcription profile of CD4(+) T cells revealed that 6 candidate target genes were involved in the development of VKH disease. The promoter 5-hmC and mRNA levels of leucine rich repeat containing 39 (LRRC39) were verified to be elevated in active VKH patients. Functional experiments showed that TET2 could up-regulate LRRC39 mRNA expression by increasing the promoter 5-hmC level of LRRC39 in CD4(+) T cells from active VKH patients. Up-regulated LRRC39 expression could increase the frequencies of IFN-gamma(+) and IL-17(+) CD4(+) T cells as well as the secretions of IFN-gamma and IL-17 in association with the decreased frequency of CD4(+)CD25(+)FOXP3(+) regulatory T (Treg) cells and the reduced production of IL-10. Additionally, restoration of LRRC39 rescued TET2-silencing-mediated reduced frequency of IFN-gamma(+) CD4(+) T cells and increased frequency of CD4(+)CD25(+)FOXP3(+) Treg cells. Collectively, our study reveals a novel axis, TET2-5-hmC-LRRC39-Th1/Treg responses axis, in the pathogenesis of VKH and provides a potential target for further investigation into the epigenetic therapy of this disease.', 'CI': ['Copyright (c) 2023.

METHODS: Individual finite element models of myopic eyes were constructed based on the clinical data. Then, four types of corneal cap thicknesses after SMILE were included for each model. The biomechanical effects of material parameters and intraocular pressure on corneas with different cap thicknesses were analyzed. RESULTS: When the cap thickness increased, the vertex displacements of the anterior and posterior corneal surfaces decreased slightly. The corneal stress distributions demonstrated little change. Regarding wave-front aberrations caused by the displacements of the anterior surface, the absolute defocus value decreased slightly, but the magnitude of primary spherical aberration increased slightly. The horizontal coma increased, and the levels of other low-order and high-order aberrations were small and demonstrated little change. The corneal vertex displacement and wave-front aberration were significantly affected by elastic modulus and intraocular pressure, whereas the corneal stress distribution was greatly affected by intraocular pressure. There were obvious individual differences in the biomechanical responses of human eyes. CONCLUSIONS: The biomechanical difference of different corneal cap thicknesses after SMILE was small. The effect of corneal cap thickness was significantly less than that resulting from material parameters and intraocular pressure. TRANSLATIONAL RELEVANCE: Individual models were constructed based on the clinical data. The elastic modulus was controlled by programming to simulate its heterogeneous distribution in the actual human eye. The simulation was improved to bridge the gap between basic research and clinical care.', 'FAU': ['Fang, Lihua', 'Jin, Tianzi', 'Cao, Yu', 'Li, Xuefeng', 'Hu, Jialin', 'Zhao, Xinheng', 'Wang, Yan'], 'AU': ['Fang L', 'Jin T', 'Cao Y', 'Li X', 'Hu J', 'Zhao X', 'Wang Y'], 'AD': ['Key Laboratory of Nondestructive Test (Ministry of Education), Nanchang Hangkong University, Nanchang, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Nondestructive Test (Ministry of Education), Nanchang Hangkong University, Nanchang, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Nondestructive Test (Ministry of Education), Nanchang Hangkong University, Nanchang, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Nondestructive Test (Ministry of Education), Nanchang Hangkong University, Nanchang, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Nondestructive Test (Ministry of Education), Nanchang Hangkong University, Nanchang, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Nondestructive Test (Ministry of Education), Nanchang Hangkong University, Nanchang, China.', 'Tianjin Key Lab of Ophthalmology and Visual Science, Tianjin Eye Institute, Tianjin Eye Hospital; Nankai University Eye Institute, Nankai University; Clinical College of Ophthalmology, Tianjin Medical University, Tianjin, China.'], 'LA': ['eng'], 'PT': ['Journal Article'], 'PL': 'United States', 'TA': 'Transl Vis Sci Technol', 'JT': 'Translational vision science & technology', 'JID': '101595919', 'SB': 'IM', 'MH': ['Humans', 'Finite Element Analysis', 'Visual Acuity', '*Corneal Surgery, Laser/methods', 'Cornea', '*Myopia/surgery'], 'PMC': 'PMC10082386', 'COIS': ['Disclosure: L.

Previous studies suggested that genetic variation may perturb the RNA secondary structure (RSS), influence protein recruitment and binding, and ultimately affect splicing processes. Therefore, exploring the perturbation of SNPs to structure-function correlations may provide an effective bridge toward understanding the genetic contribution to diseases. Here, aiming to decipher the regulatory mechanism of myopia susceptibility variants, we systematically evaluated the roles of SNP-induced structural changes during splicing. 7.53% of myopia-related SNPs exhibited significant global structural changes, 19.53% presented noteworthy local structural disturbance, and there were wide-ranging structural perturbations in the splice-related motifs. We established a comprehensive evaluation system for structural disturbance in the splicing-related motifs, and gave the priority ranking for the SNPs at RNA structural level. These high-priority SNPS were revealed to widely disturb the molecular interaction properties between splicing-related proteins and pre-mRNAs by HDOCK. Moreover, mini-gene assays confirmed that structural perturbation could influence splicing efficiency through structural remodelling. This study deepens our understanding of the potential molecular regulatory mechanisms of susceptible SNPs in myopia, and contributes to personalized diagnosis, personalized medicine, disease-risk prediction, and functional verification study by guiding the prioritization of the susceptibility SNPs.', 'CI': ['(c) The Author(s) 2023.

factor (anti-VEGF) injections are the standard of care for diabetic macular edema (DME), a common complication of diabetes. This study aimed to identify factors influencing DME intravitreal anti-VEGF treatment outcomes in real-world practice. METHODS: This was a multi-center retrospective observational study using medical chart review of participants receiving anti-VEGF injections for DME (N = 248). Demographic and clinical variables were assessed for association with best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) and central macular thickness (CMT) outcomes using regression models. RESULTS: There was a significant improvement in BCVA (p < 0.001) and CMT (p < 0.001) after 12 months of treatment, although 21% of participants had decreased BCVA, and 41% had a < 10% CMT reduction at 12 months. Higher baseline BCVA (p = 0.022, OR=-0.024, 95% CI=-0.046,-0.004) and longer duration of diabetic retinopathy (p = 0.048, OR=-0.064, 95% CI=-0.129,-0.001) were negative predictors for BCVA response, whereas Aflibercept treatment (p = 0.017, OR = 1.107, 95% CI = 0.220,2.051) compared with other drugs and a positive \"early functional response\" (p < 0.001, OR=-1.393, 95% CI=-1.946,-0.857) were positive predictors. A higher baseline CMT (p < 0.001, OR = 0.019, 95% CI = 0.012,0.0261) and an \"early anatomical response\", (p < 0.001, OR=-1.677, 95% CI=-2.456, -0.943) were predictors for greater reduction in CMT. Overall, the variables could predict only 23% of BCVA and 52% of CMT response. CONCLUSIONS: The study shows a significant proportion of DME patients do not respond to anti-VEGF therapy and identifies several clinical predictors for treatment outcomes.

METHODS: This study was designed as a cross-sectional study. Data were derived from a school-based prospective children myopia intervention study (STORM). Outdoor time was recorded by self-developed algorithm-validated wristwatches in real-time and calculated as the cumulative average of 10 months. The academic performance was recorded and provided by the participating schools and further standardized. Other information was collected using an online standardized questionnaire. Mixed-effects model and B-Spline method were used to investigate the association between time spent on different types of daily activity, including outdoor activity and academic performance. RESULTS: A total of 3291 children with mean age 9.25 years were included in the final analysis. Overall, outdoor time was associated with academic performance in a non-linear manner; specifically, not exceeding 2.3 h per day, outdoor time was positively associated with academic performance; exceeding 2.3 h per day, this association became non-significant. Likewise, daily sleep duration and out-of-school learning time were associated with academic performance in a non-linear manner, resulting in turning points of 11.3 and 1.4 h per day, respectively. Separate analysis showed that outdoor time and sleep duration but not out-of-school learning time were positively associated with academic performance in Chinese, mathematics and English. CONCLUSION: Outdoor time, sleep duration and out-of-school learning time were associated with academic performance in a non-linear manner. Promotion of outdoor time may not negatively impact on academic performance. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Our study was registered in ClinicalTrials.gov (Identifier: NCT02980445).', 'CI': ['(c) 2023.

Yet, there is a lack of knowledge about the clinical characteristics, therapeutic options and profile of patients with PACG in China. Hence, we design the China Glaucoma Treatment Pattern Study Ⅰ-Primary Angle-Closure Glaucoma (Ch-GTPⅠ). The objective of this paper is to describe the design and methodology of Ch-GTP. The aim of this study is to characterise the profile and trend associated with initial PACG treatment for the last 10 years in China. METHODS: Ch-GTPⅠ is a national multicentre retrospective observational study that will randomly sample from 50 hospitals throughout China. Over 7000 patient records hospitalised for initial PACG treatment from 2011 to 2020 will be selected randomly. The data from electronic medical records will be uploaded to an encrypted online platform that will receive and collate data from all collaborating hospitals. Data abstraction and monitoring will be performed in a standardised manner by trained statisticians to ensure consistency. Systematic data cleaning will also be conducted by statisticians to ensure data integrity before final data storage. The outcomes will include four broad categories: (1) demographics, (2) clinical characteristics, (3) therapeutic strategies and procedures and (4) early outcomes at discharge. The demographic characteristics and early outcomes will be summarised using descriptive statistics. Comparative analyses of characteristics and treatment pattern changing trends for different regions and years will be used to test for significant differences (t-test or Mann-Whitney U test). ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The collaborating hospitals obtained local approval based on a standard ethics application from internal ethics committees or acknowledged an existent ethics approval of the leading institution with approval from internal ethics committees. Due to the retrospective nature, written informed consent from patients was waived by the ethics committee.

METHODS: The 2021 EAN/PNS clinical criteria for CIDP were applied to 329 patients fulfilling the electrodiagnostic (and in some cases also the supportive) criteria for the diagnosis of CIDP. Clinical characteristics were reviewed for each patient not strictly fulfilling the clinical criteria ('unclassifiable'). RESULTS: At study inclusion, 124 (37.5%) patients had an unclassifiable clinical presentation, including 110 (89%) with a typical CIDP-like clinical phenotype in whom some segments of the four limbs were unaffected by weakness ('incomplete typical CIDP'), 10 (8%) with a mild distal, symmetric, sensory or sensorimotor polyneuropathy confined to the lower limbs with cranial nerve involvement ('cranial nerve predominant CIDP') and 4 (1%) with a symmetric sensorimotor polyneuropathy limited to the proximal and distal areas of the lower limbs ('paraparetic CIDP'). Eighty-one (65%) patients maintained an unclassifiable presentation during the entire disease follow-up while 13 patients progressed to typical CIDP. Patients with the unclassifiable clinical forms compared with patients with typical CIDP had a milder form of CIDP, while there was no difference in the distribution patterns of demyelination. CONCLUSIONS: A proportion of patients with CIDP do not strictly fulfil the 2021 EAN/PNS clinical criteria for diagnosis. These unclassifiable clinical phenotypes may pose diagnostic challenges and thus deserve more attention in clinical practice and research.\", 'CI': ['(c) Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2023.

Eighty-six patients aged >/=18 years with OAG or OHT, with intraocular pressure (IOP) initially controlled for at least 6 months by a combination therapy of a dual prostaglandin and timolol or insufficiently controlled by first-line monotherapy were included. Patients were randomized to receive T4030a (bimatoprost 0.01%/timolol 0.1%; N = 29), T4030c (bimatoprost 0.01%/timolol 0.5%; N = 29) or bimatoprost 0.03%/timolol 0.5% (N = 28), administered once daily in the evening for 12 weeks. Primary endpoint was defined as change in IOP from day 1 to week 12 measured at 08:00 (+/-1 hour). Further efficacy, safety and pharmacokinetic endpoints were assessed as secondary outcomes.Results: The mean change in IOP from baseline to week 12 was -9.8 +/- 2.1 mmHg for T4030a, -10.1 +/- 2.5 mmHg for T4030c and -10.0 +/- 2.8 mmHg for bimatoprost 0.03%/timolol 0.5%.

In addition, alterations in OCTA parameters can precede the clinical fundus changes. In this review, we aimed to assess the accuracy of OCTA in diagnosis and staging of diabetic retinopathy. METHODS: Two independent reviewers participated in the literature search using electronic databases (PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library Central Register of Controlled Trials, ISI, and Scopus) from inception till December 2020. The heterogeneity of data was assessed by Q statistics, Chi-square test and I(2) index. RESULTS: Forty-four articles published from 2015 to the end of 2020 were included in this meta-analysis. Of these, 27 were case-control studies, 9 were case series, and 8 were cohort studies. In total, 4284 eyes of 3553 patients were assessed in this study. OCTA could differentiate diabetic retinopathy from diabetes without diabetic retinopathy with a sensitivity of 88% (95% CI: 85% to 92%) and specificity of 88% (95% CI: 85% to 91%). In addition, it could differentiate proliferative diabetic retinopathy from non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy with a sensitivity of 91% (95% CI: 86% to 95%) and specificity of 91% (95% CI:86% to 96%). The sensitivity of OCTA for diagnosing diabetic retinopathy was increased by the size of scan (3 x 3 mm: 85%; 6 x 6 mm: 91%, 12 x 12 mm: 96%). CONCLUSION: OCTA, as a non-invasive method, has acceptable sensitivity and specificity for diagnosis and classification of diabetic retinopathy.

This review discusses and summarizes the epidemiology and common risk factors of children with dry eye, with the aim of improving doctors' understanding of dry eye in children.\", 'FAU': ['Xie, R', 'Wang, Z R', 'Zhu, Y T', 'Yu, J H', 'Zhuo, Y H'], 'AU': ['Xie R', 'Wang ZR', 'Zhu YT', 'Yu JH', 'Zhuo YH'], 'AD': ['Zhongshan Ophthalmic Center, SunYat-sen University, State Key Laboratory of Ophthalmology, Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Ophthalmology and Visual Science, Guangdong Provincial Clinical Research Center for Ocular Diseases, Guangzhou 510060, China.', 'Zhongshan Ophthalmic Center, SunYat-sen University, State Key Laboratory of Ophthalmology, Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Ophthalmology and Visual Science, Guangdong Provincial Clinical Research Center for Ocular Diseases, Guangzhou 510060, China.', 'Zhongshan Ophthalmic Center, SunYat-sen University, State Key Laboratory of Ophthalmology, Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Ophthalmology and Visual Science, Guangdong Provincial Clinical Research Center for Ocular Diseases, Guangzhou 510060, China.', 'Affiliated Foshan Maternity & Child Healthcare Hospital, Southern Medical University (Foshan Maternity & Child Healthcare Hospital), Foshan 528000, China.', 'Zhongshan Ophthalmic Center, SunYat-sen University, State Key Laboratory of Ophthalmology, Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Ophthalmology and Visual Science, Guangdong Provincial Clinical Research Center for Ocular Diseases, Guangzhou 510060, China.'], 'LA': ['chi'], 'GR': ['2020YFA0112700/National Key Research and Development Project of China/', '202102010216/Science and Technology Program of Guangzhou, China/'], 'PT': ['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', 'Review'], 'PL': 'China', 'TA': 'Zhonghua Yan Ke Za Zhi', 'JT': '[Zhonghua yan ke za zhi] Chinese journal of ophthalmology', 'JID': '16210540R', 'SB': 'IM', 'MH': ['Humans', 'Child', '*Dry Eye Syndromes/diagnosis', 'Risk Factors', 'Prevalence'], 'EDAT': '2023/04/04 06:00', 'MHDA': '2023/04/05 06:42', 'CRDT': ['2023/04/03 23:32'], 'PHST': ['2023/04/05 06:42 [medline]', '2023/04/03 23:32 [entrez]', '2023/04/04 06:00 [pubmed]'], 'AID': ['10.3760/cma.j.cn112142-20220804-00379 [doi]'], 'PST': 'ppublish', 'SO': 'Zhonghua Yan Ke Za Zhi. 2023 Apr 11;59(4):321-325. doi: 10.3760/cma.j.cn112142-20220804-00379.'}, {'PMID': '37012592', 'OWN': 'NLM', 'STAT': 'MEDLINE', 'DCOM': '20230405', 'LR': '20230405', 'IS': '0412-4081 (Print) 0412-4081 (Linking)', 'VI': '59', 'IP': '4', 'DP': '2023 Apr 11', 'TI': '[Femtosecond laser-assisted minimally invasive lamellar keratoplasty for advanced keratoconus].', 'PG': '288-294', 'LID': '10.3760/cma.j.cn112142-20220517-00249 [doi]', 'AB': 'Objective: To evaluate the initial safety and efficacy of femtosecond laser-assisted minimally invasive lamellar keratoplasty (FL-MILK) for advanced keratoconus. Methods: It was a case series study. Patients with advanced keratoconus who underwent FL-MILK between August 2017 and April 2020 at Shandong Eye Hospital were prospectively included. The femtosecond laser was used to create an intrastromal pocket in the recipient cornea and a lamellar cornea in the donor. The lamellar cornea was then gently inserted into the intrastromal pocket through the incision and flattened. Clinical measurements included best-corrected visual acuity, 3-mm anterior corneal mean keratometry, anterior and posterior central corneal elevation, central corneal thickness, corneal biomechanics, and endothelial cell density. The follow-up was conducted at 1 month, 12 months, and 24 months after the operation. Results: There were 33 patients (35 eyes) in the study. Twenty-six patients were male and 7 patients were female. The mean age was (20.34+/-5.24) years old. All patients completed 12 months of follow-up, and 25 patients (27 eyes) completed 24 months of follow-up. No epithelial ingrowth, infection, or allogeneic rejection was observed. Compared with the preoperative data, the anterior central corneal elevation significantly decreased (P<0.001), the mean keratometry significantly decreased (P<0.05), and the central corneal thickness significantly increased (P<0.001). The corneal biomechanical strength was significantly improved, with the deformation amplitude ratio at 2.0 mm decreasing from 1.39+/-0.14 preoperatively to 1.21+/-0.10 at 24 months postoperatively (P<0.001) and the stiffness parameter at the first applanation increasing from 41.49+/-11.47 preoperatively to 88.41+/-18.17 at 24 months postoperatively (P<0.001). There were no significant changes in the mean best-corrected visual acuity, posterior corneal elevation, mean spherical equivalent, and endothelial cell density (all P>0.05).

Methods: It was a retrospective case series study. Medical records of 16 consecutive patients (16 eyes) with Nocardia keratitis were collected from the Department of Ophthalmology at Beijing Tongren Hospital, Capital Medical University between 2018 and 2022. The group consisted of 11 males and 5 females. The inclusion criteria for the study were the presence of typical clinical manifestations of Nocardia keratitis and at least one positive pathogenic test (corneal scraping or microbial culture) indicating Nocardia infection. The medical history, clinical and microbiological examination data of the patients were analyzed, including risk factors, diagnosis time, clinical manifestations, diagnostic methods, strain isolation, cure time, and best corrected visual acuity before and after treatment. This study utilized techniques such as slit lamp microscopy, in vivo confocal microscopy (IVCM), scraping cytology, microbial culture, and mass spectrometry identification. Results: The main risk factors for Nocardia keratitis included plant or foreign body injuries (5 out of 16 cases), contact lens use (4 out of 16 cases), and surgery (2 out of 16 cases). The average time to diagnosis was (20.8+/-11.8) days, with the shortest time being 8 days and the longest being 60 days. The best corrected visual acuity was less than 0.05 in 7 patients, between 0.05 to 0.3 in 7 patients, and greater than or equal to 0.3 in 2 patients. The typical symptoms included superficial gray-white infiltration in a wreath-like pattern on the cornea, corneal ulcers with dry and gray-white necrotic tissue coverage, and in severe cases, corneal ulcer perforation. Nocardia corneal infection was identified in 12 out of 16 cases by scraping cytology, 9 out of 16 cases by mass spectrometry, and 8 out of 16 cases by both methods. IVCM showed the presence of fine and moderately reflective filamentous hyphae in the subepithelial and superficial stromal layer of the cornea, arranged in elongated, beaded, and branched structures. Infiltration of many hyper-reflective round inflammatory cells was also seen around the hyphae. Fourteen cases were treated with medication and 2 cases were treated with corneal transplantation. The average cure time was (37.5+/-25.2) days and there were no cases of recurrence during the follow-up period (all greater than 6 months). Conclusions: Nocardia keratitis is primarily characterized by dense, round, or wreath-like infiltration in the early stage, and by gray-white dry necrotic secretion and hypopyon on the surface of corneal ulcers in the middle and late stages. Fine, branched or beaded, and moderately reflective filamentous structures are the hallmark of the corneal lesion on the IVCM images.', 'FAU': ['Guo, X Y', 'Wang, Z Q', 'Chen, K X', 'Zhang, Y', 'Wei, Z Y', 'Liang, Q F'], 'AU': ['Guo XY', 'Wang ZQ', 'Chen KX', 'Zhang Y', 'Wei ZY', 'Liang QF'], 'AD': ['Beijing Tongren Eye Center, Beijing Tongren Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing Institute of Ophthalmology, Beijing Key Laboratory of Ophthalmology & Visual Sciences, Beijing 100730, China.', 'Beijing Tongren Eye Center, Beijing Tongren Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing Institute of Ophthalmology, Beijing Key Laboratory of Ophthalmology & Visual Sciences, Beijing 100730, China.', 'Beijing Tongren Eye Center, Beijing Tongren Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing Institute of Ophthalmology, Beijing Key Laboratory of Ophthalmology & Visual Sciences, Beijing 100730, China.', 'Beijing Tongren Eye Center, Beijing Tongren Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing Institute of Ophthalmology, Beijing Key Laboratory of Ophthalmology & Visual Sciences, Beijing 100730, China.', 'Beijing Tongren Eye Center, Beijing Tongren Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing Institute of Ophthalmology, Beijing Key Laboratory of Ophthalmology & Visual Sciences, Beijing 100730, China.', 'Beijing Tongren Eye Center, Beijing Tongren Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing Institute of Ophthalmology, Beijing Key Laboratory of Ophthalmology & Visual Sciences, Beijing 100730, China.'], 'LA': ['chi'], 'GR': ['81470607/National Natural Science Foundation of China/', 'BHTR-KFJJ-202003/Open Research Fund from Beijing Advanced Innovation Center for', 'Big Data-Based Precision Medicine, Beijing Tongren Hospital, Beihang University &', 'Capital Medical University/'], 'PT': ['English Abstract', 'Journal Article'], 'PL': 'China', 'TA': 'Zhonghua Yan Ke Za Zhi', 'JT': '[Zhonghua yan ke za zhi] Chinese journal of ophthalmology', 'JID': '16210540R', 'SB': 'IM', 'MH': ['Male', 'Female', 'Humans', '*Nocardia', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Ulcer', '*Keratitis/microbiology', '*Corneal Ulcer', 'Cornea', 'Microscopy, Confocal/methods'], 'EDAT': '2023/04/04 06:00', 'MHDA': '2023/04/05 06:42', 'CRDT': ['2023/04/03 23:32'], 'PHST': ['2023/04/05 06:42 [medline]', '2023/04/03 23:32 [entrez]', '2023/04/04 06:00 [pubmed]'], 'AID': ['10.3760/cma.j.cn112142-20221001-00480 [doi]'], 'PST': 'ppublish', 'SO': 'Zhonghua Yan Ke Za Zhi. 2023 Apr 11;59(4):279-287. doi: 10.3760/cma.j.cn112142-20221001-00480.'}, {'PMID': '37012589', 'OWN': 'NLM', 'STAT': 'MEDLINE', 'DCOM': '20230405', 'LR': '20230405', 'IS': '0412-4081 (Print) 0412-4081 (Linking)', 'VI': '59', 'IP': '4', 'DP': '2023 Apr 11', 'TI': '[A multicenter clinical trial of collar-button type keratoprosthesis implantation for the treatment of corneal blindness in high-risk transplantation].', 'PG': '262-271', 'LID': '10.3760/cma.j.cn112142-20221103-00565 [doi]', 'AB': 'Objective: To evaluate the efficiency and safety of collar-button type keratoprosthesis (c-bKPro) implantation for corneal blindness in high-risk transplantation in China.

Additionally, the deep integration of cutting-edge technologies such as 5G, virtual reality, and surgical robots would advance the development of ophthalmic intelligent medicine into a new phase.', 'FAU': ['Yuan, J', 'Xiao, P'], 'AU': ['Yuan J', 'Xiao P'], 'AD': ['Zhongshan Ophthalmic Center, SunYat-sen University, State Key Laboratory of Ophthalmology, Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Ophthalmology and Visual Science, Guangdong Provincial Clinical Research Center for Ocular Diseases, Guangzhou 510060, China.', 'Zhongshan Ophthalmic Center, SunYat-sen University, State Key Laboratory of Ophthalmology, Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Ophthalmology and Visual Science, Guangdong Provincial Clinical Research Center for Ocular Diseases, Guangzhou 510060, China.'], 'LA': ['chi'], 'GR': ['82230033, 82271133/National Natural Science Foundation of China/', '2021TX06Y127, 2021TQ06Y137/Guangdong Province Department of Science and', 'Technology Fund Project/'], 'PT': ['English Abstract', 'Journal Article'], 'PL': 'China', 'TA': 'Zhonghua Yan Ke Za Zhi', 'JT': '[Zhonghua yan ke za zhi] Chinese journal of ophthalmology', 'JID': '16210540R', 'SB': 'IM', 'MH': ['Humans', 'Artificial Intelligence', '*Ophthalmology/methods', 'Algorithms', '*Eye Diseases/diagnosis'], 'EDAT': '2023/04/04 06:00', 'MHDA': '2023/04/05 06:42', 'CRDT': ['2023/04/03 23:32'], 'PHST': ['2023/04/05 06:42 [medline]', '2023/04/03 23:32 [entrez]', '2023/04/04 06:00 [pubmed]'], 'AID': ['10.3760/cma.j.cn112142-20230221-00061 [doi]'], 'PST': 'ppublish', 'SO': 'Zhonghua Yan Ke Za Zhi. 2023 Apr 11;59(4):245-249. doi: 10.3760/cma.j.cn112142-20230221-00061.'}, {'PMID': '37012508', 'OWN': 'NLM', 'STAT': 'Publisher', 'LR': '20230403', 'IS': '1748-3395 (Electronic) 1748-3387 (Linking)', 'DP': '2023 Apr 3', 'TI': 'Ectopic expression of a mechanosensitive channel confers spatiotemporal resolution to ultrasound stimulations of neurons for visual restoration.', 'LID': '10.1038/s41565-023-01359-6 [doi]', 'AB': 'Remote and precisely controlled activation of the brain is a fundamental challenge in the development of brain-machine interfaces for neurological treatments.

Most patients with diabetes are monitored through the diabetic eye screening programme (DESP) until they have signs of retinopathy and these changes progress, requiring referral into hospital eye services (HES). Here, they continue to be monitored until they require treatment. Due to current pressures on HES, delays can occur, leading to harm. There is a need to triage patients based on their individual risk. At present, patients are stratified according to retinopathy stage alone, yet other risk factors like glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) may be useful. Therefore, a prediction model that combines multiple prognostic factors to predict progression will be useful for triage in this setting to improve care.We previously developed a Diabetic Retinopathy Progression model to Treatment or Vision Loss (DRPTVL-UK) using a large primary care database. The aim of the present study is to externally validate the DRPTVL-UK model in a secondary care setting, specifically in a population under care by HES. This study will also provide an opportunity to update the model by considering additional predictors not previously available. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: We will use a retrospective cohort of 2400 patients with diabetes aged 12 years and over, referred from DESP to the NHS hospital trusts with referable DR between 2013 and 2016, with follow-up information recorded until December 2021.We will evaluate the external validity of the DRPTVL-UK model using measures of discrimination, calibration and net benefit. In addition, consensus meetings will be held to agree on acceptable risk thresholds for triage within the HES system. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This study was approved by REC (ref 22/SC/0425, 05/12/2022, Hampshire A Research Ethics Committee). The results of the study will be published in a peer-reviewed journal, presented at clinical conferences.

OT is the leading cause of posterior uveitis globally; it is a recurrent disease that may result in visual impairment and blindness. This systematic review and meta-analysis aim to summarize and evaluate the risk factors for recurrences, visual impairment, and blindness described in the literature worldwide. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We performed a systematic literature search in PubMed, Embase, VHL, Cochrane Library, Scopus, and DANS EASY Archive. All studies reporting patients with clinically and serologically confirmed OT presenting any clinical or paraclinical factor influencing recurrences, visual impairment, and blindness were included. Studies presenting secondary data, case reports, and case series were excluded. An initial selection was made by title and abstract, and then the studies were reviewed by full text where the eligible studies were selected. Then, the risk of bias was assessed through validated tools. Data were extracted using a validated extraction format. Qualitative synthesis and quantitative analysis were done. This study was registered on PROSPERO (CRD42022327836). RESULTS: Seventy two studies met the inclusion criteria. Fifty-three were summarized in the qualitative synthesis in three sections: clinical and environmental factors, parasite and host factors, and treatment-related factors. Of the 72 articles, 39 were included in the meta-analysis, of which 14 were conducted in South America, 13 in Europe, four in Asia, three multinational, two in North America and Central America, respectively, and only one in Africa. A total of 4,200 patients with OT were analyzed, mean age ranged from 7.3 to 65.1 year of age, with similar distribution by sex. The frequency of recurrences in patients with OT was 49% (95% CI 40%-58%), being more frequent in the South American population than in Europeans. Additionally, visual impairment was presented in 35% (95% CI 25%-48%) and blindness in 20% (95% CI 13%-30%) of eyes, with a similar predominance in South Americans than in Europeans. On the other hand, having lesions near the macula or adjacent to the optic nerve had an OR of 4.83 (95% CI; 2.72-8.59) for blindness, similar to having more than one recurrence that had an OR of 3.18 (95% CI; 1.59-6.38). Finally, the prophylactic therapy with Trimethoprim/Sulfamethoxazole versus the placebo showed a protective factor of 83% during the first year and 87% in the second year after treatment. CONCLUSION: Our Systematic Review showed that clinical factors such as being older than 40 years, patients with de novo OT lesions or with less than one year after the first episode, macular area involvement, lesions greater than 1 disc diameter, congenital toxoplasmosis, and bilateral compromise had more risk of recurrences. Also, environmental and parasite factors such as precipitations, geographical region where the infection is acquired, and more virulent strains confer greater risk of recurrences. Therefore, patients with the above mentioned clinical, environmental, and parasite factors could benefit from using prophylactic therapy.', 'CI': ['Copyright: (c) 2023 Cifuentes-Gonzalez et al.

Axons with similar patterns of neural activity converge onto target neurons and stabilize their synapses with these postsynaptic partners, restricting exploratory branch elaboration (Hebbian structural plasticity). On the other hand, non-correlated firing in inputs leads to synapse weakening and increased exploratory growth of axons (Stentian structural plasticity). We used visual stimulation to control the correlation structure of neural activity in a few ipsilaterally projecting (ipsi) retinal ganglion cell (RGC) axons with respect to the majority contralateral eye inputs in the optic tectum of albino Xenopus laevis tadpoles. Multiphoton live imaging of ipsi axons, combined with specific targeted disruptions of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) signaling, revealed that both presynaptic p75NTR and TrkB are required for Stentian axonal branch addition, whereas presumptive postsynaptic BDNF signaling is necessary for Hebbian axon stabilization. Additionally, we found that BDNF signaling mediates local suppression of branch elimination in response to correlated firing of inputs. Daily in vivo imaging of contralateral RGC axons demonstrated that p75NTR knockdown reduces axon branch elongation and arbor spanning field volume.', 'CI': ['Copyright: (c) 2023 Kutsarova et al.

Studies have reported the effectiveness of anti-VEGF medications for the control of intraocular pressure (IOP) in NVG. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effectiveness of intraocular anti-VEGF medications, alone or with one or more types of conventional therapy, compared with no anti-VEGF medications for the treatment of NVG. SEARCH METHODS: We searched CENTRAL (which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Trials Register); MEDLINE; Embase; PubMed; and LILACS to 19 October 2021; metaRegister of Controlled Trials to 19 October 2021; and two additional trial registers to 19 October 2021. We did not use any date or language restrictions in the electronic search for trials. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of people treated with anti-VEGF medications for NVG. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently assessed the search results for trials, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias, and the certainty of the evidence. We resolved discrepancies through discussion. MAIN RESULTS: We included five RCTs (356 eyes of 353 participants). Each trial was conducted in a different country: two in China, and one each in Brazil, Egypt, and Japan. All five RCTs included both men and women; the mean age of participants was 55 years or older. Two RCTs compared intravitreal bevacizumab combined with Ahmed valve implantation and panretinal photocoagulation (PRP) with Ahmed valve implantation and PRP alone. One RCT randomized participants to receive an injection of either intravitreal aflibercept or placebo at the first visit, followed by non-randomized treatment according to clinical findings after one week. The remaining two RCTs randomized participants to PRP with and without ranibizumab, one of which had insufficient details for further analysis. We assessed the RCTs to have an unclear risk of bias for most domains due to insufficient information to permit judgment.   Four RCTs examined achieving control of IOP, three of which reported our time points of interest. Only one RCT reported our critical time point at one month; it found that the anti-VEGF group had a 1.3-fold higher chance of achieving control of IOP at one month (RR 1.32, 95% 1.10 to 1.59; 93 participants) than the non-anti-VEGF group (low certainty of evidence). For other time points, one RCT found a three-fold greater achievement in control of IOP in the anti-VEGF group when compared with the non-anti-VEGF group at one year (RR 3.00; 95% CI:1.35 to 6.68; 40 participants). However, another RCT found an inconclusive result at the time period ranging from 1.5 years to three years (RR 1.08; 95% CI: 0.67 to 1.75; 40 participants).  All five RCTs examined mean IOP, but at different time points. Very-low-certainty evidence showed that anti-VEGFs were effective in reducing mean IOP by 6.37 mmHg (95% CI: -10.09 to -2.65; 3 RCTs; 173 participants) at four to six weeks when compared with no anti-VEGFs.  Anti-VEGFs may reduce mean IOP at three months (MD -4.25; 95% CI -12.05 to 3.54; 2 studies; 75 participants), six months (MD -5.93; 95% CI -18.13 to 6.26; 2 studies; 75 participants), one year (MD -5.36; 95% CI -18.50 to 7.77; 2 studies; 75 participants), and more than one year (MD -7.05; 95% CI -16.61 to 2.51; 2 studies; 75 participants) when compared with no anti-VEGFs, but such effects remain uncertain. Two RCTs reported the proportion of participants who achieved an improvement in visual acuity with specified time points. Participants receiving anti-VEGFs had a 2.6 times (95% CI 1.60 to 4.08; 1 study; 93 participants) higher chance of improving visual acuity when compared with those not receiving anti-VEGFs at one month (very low certainty of evidence). Likewise, another RCT found a similar result at 18 months (RR 4.00, 95% CI 1.33 to 12.05; 1 study; 40 participants).  Two RCTs reported the outcome, complete regression of new iris vessels, at our time points of interest. Low-certainty evidence showed that anti-VEGFs had a nearly three times higher chance of complete regression of new iris vessels when compared with no anti-VEGFs (RR 2.63, 95% CI 1.65 to 4.18; 1 study; 93 participants). A similar finding was observed at more than one year in another RCT (RR 3.20, 95% CI 1.45 to 7.05; 1 study; 40 participants).  Regarding adverse events, there was no evidence that the risks of hypotony and tractional retinal detachment were different between the two groups (RR 0.67; 95% CI: 0.12 to 3.57 and RR 0.33; 95% CI: 0.01 to 7.72, respectively; 1 study; 40 participants). No RCTs reported incidents of endophthalmitis, vitreous hemorrhage, no light perception, and serious adverse events. Evidence for the adverse events of anti-VEGFs was low due to limitations in the study design due to insufficient information to permit judgments and imprecision of results due to the small sample size. No trial reported the proportion of participants with relief of pain and resolution of redness at any time point. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Anti-VEGFs as an adjunct to conventional treatment could help reduce IOP in NVG in the short term (four to six weeks), but there is no evidence that this is likely in the longer term. Currently available evidence regarding the short- and long-term effectiveness and safety of anti-VEGFs in achieving control of IOP, visual acuity, and complete regression of new iris vessels in NVG is insufficient. More research is needed to investigate the effect of these medications compared with, or in addition to, conventional surgical or medical treatment in achieving these outcomes in NVG.\", 'CI': ['Copyright (c) 2023 The Cochrane Collaboration.

While several reviews have collective information on the biomedical application of exosomes, a comprehensive review incorporating updated and improved methodologies for beneficial applications of such vesicles in cancer theranostics is indispensable. In the current review, we first provided a comprehensive review of the introduction of exosomes, featuring their discovery, separation, characterization, function, biogenesis, secretion. The implications of exosomes as promising nanovehicles for drug and gene delivery, application of exosome inhibitors in the management of cancers, completed and ongoing clinical trials on the biological relevance of exosomes are then discussed in detail.

METHODS: This prospective study included 66 patients (83 eyes) with age-related cataracts. Using the Lens Opacities Classification System III (LOCS III), the lens nuclear color (NC), lens nuclear opalescence (NO), cortical (C), and posterior subcapsular (P) opacities were obtained. Six meridian orientations of IOL-Master 700 images were captured, and the lens and nuclear regions were analyzed using ImageJ to generate the average lens nucleus density (AND) and average lens density (ALD). Phacodynamic parameters were recorded. The correlation between lens density and the phacodynamic parameters was analyzed. According to the AND, patients were divided into four groups (soft, medium-hard, hard, and extremely hard nucleus), and the phacodynamic parameters were compared among groups. RESULTS: The correlation between the AND obtained by LOCS III grading and SS-OCT-based cataract quantification system score (NC and NO) was statistically significant (r(NC) = 0.795, r(NO)=0.794, both p = .000). AND correlated significantly with cumulative dissipated energy (CDE, r = 0.545, p = .000), total ultrasound time (TUST, r = 0.354, p = .001), and total torsional ultrasound time (TTUT, r = 0.314, p = .004). Among the four groups divided by AND, the difference in CDE (P(13) = 0.002, P(14) < 0.001, P(24) = 0.002) was statistically significant. CONCLUSION: AND measured by IOL-Master 700, SS-OCT correlated significantly with LOCS III classification and phacodynamic parameters of the Centurion system, especially with CDE, TUST, and TTUT.

Percentages and absolute numbers were used to report the proportion of patients who experienced various outcomes of interest. RESULTS: The study comprised 32 cases. All cases occurred in pseudophakic eyes; of those, 8 (25.0%) had posterior chamber intraocular lenses in the capsular bag with no known capsular or zonular issues. The mean duration from DEX implant injection to detection of migration was 19.4 +/- 14.5 days. The DEX implant was explanted in 21 patients (65.6%) and repositioned in the vitreous cavity or subconjunctival space in 6 patients (18.8%). Twelve patients (37.5%) ultimately required corneal transplantation. CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this is the largest case series of DEX intravitreal implant migration into the AC compiled to date.

Musculoskeletal manifestations are common in most patients. We report the cases of two children with PWS who developed inflammatory arthritis, complicated with chronic anterior bilateral uveitis in one case. To our knowledge, no previous reports of such an association exist. CASE PRESENTATION: Case 1 was of a 3-year-old girl diagnosed with PWS who developed arthritis of the right knee with morning stiffness, joint swelling, and limited range of motion. Other causes of arthritis were ruled out. Increased inflammatory markers, antinuclear antibody (ANA) positivity, and hypertrophic synovitis on ultrasound confirmed the diagnosis of inflammatory arthritis compatible with juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA). Despite the treatment with methotrexate, arthritis progressed, and etanercept was added. The patient reached and maintained articular remission while on combined MTX and etanercept treatment during 9 years of follow-up. Case 2 was of a 6-year-old boy diagnosed with PWS who developed arthritis of the right knee. Laboratory investigations showed mildly increased acute phase reactants, microcytic anemia, and ANA positivity at high titer (titer 1:1,280). Infectious and other causes of arthritis were excluded. Ultrasound confirmed the presence of joint effusion and synovial thickening, and synovial fluid analysis was consistent with inflammatory arthrosynovitis (white blood cell count of 14,200/microl) compatible with JIA. Shortly after the diagnosis, the ophthalmologic evaluation revealed the presence of bilateral anterior uveitis. Despite MTX and topical corticosteroid, ocular inflammation persisted and adalimumab was added. At the last follow-up, 9 months later, the child experienced inactivity of arthritis and uveitis with normal growth. CONCLUSIONS: We aim to raise awareness of this possible association among pediatricians since arthritis might be underestimated due to high pain tolerance, behavioral disturbances, and other musculoskeletal abnormalities in PWS patients.', 'CI': ['(c) 2023 Marelli, Dallos, Miserocchi, Nucci, Tombolini, Lucia, Gattinara, Caporali', 'and Marino.'], 'FAU': ['Marelli, Luca', 'Dallos, Tomas', 'Miserocchi, Elisabetta', 'Nucci, Paolo', 'Tombolini, Beatrice', 'De Lucia, Orazio', 'Gattinara, Maurizio', 'Caporali, Roberto', 'Marino, Achille'], 'AU': ['Marelli L', 'Dallos T', 'Miserocchi E', 'Nucci P', 'Tombolini B', 'De Lucia O', 'Gattinara M', 'Caporali R', 'Marino A'], 'AD': ['Eye Clinic San Giuseppe Hospital, IRCCS Multimedica Scientific Institute, Milan, Italy.', 'Second Department of Pediatrics, Comenius University Medical School, Bratislava, Slovakia.', 'School of Medicine, Vita-Salute San Raffaele University, Milan, Italy.', 'Division of Head and Neck, Ophthalmology Unit, IRCCS San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milan, Italy.', 'Department of Biomedical, Surgical and Dental Sciences, University of Milan, Milan, Italy.', 'School of Medicine, Vita-Salute San Raffaele University, Milan, Italy.', 'Division of Head and Neck, Ophthalmology Unit, IRCCS San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milan, Italy.', 'Division of Clinical Rheumatology, ASST G.Pini-CTO, Milano, Italy.', 'Unit of Pediatric Rheumatology, ASST G.Pini-CTO, Milan, Italy.', 'Division of Clinical Rheumatology, ASST G.Pini-CTO, Milano, Italy.', 'Unit of Pediatric Rheumatology, ASST G.Pini-CTO, Milan, Italy.', 'Department of Clinical Sciences and Community Health and Research Center for Pediatric and Adult Rheumatic Diseases (RECAP.RD), University of Milan, Milan, Italy.', 'Unit of Pediatric Rheumatology, ASST G.Pini-CTO, Milan, Italy.'], 'LA': ['eng'], 'PT': ['Case Reports'], 'DEP': '20230317', 'PL': 'Switzerland', 'TA': 'Front Pediatr', 'JT': 'Frontiers in pediatrics', 'JID': '101615492', 'PMC': 'PMC10063871', 'OTO': ['NOTNLM'], 'OT': ['Prader-Willi syndrome', 'arthritis', 'genetic disorders', 'human growth hormone', 'juvenile Idiopathic arthritis', 'obesity', 'uveitis'], 'COIS': ['The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any', 'commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential', 'conflict of interest.'], 'EDAT': '2023/04/04 06:00', 'MHDA': '2023/04/04 06:01', 'CRDT': ['2023/04/03 04:25'], 'PHST': ['2022/11/18 00:00 [received]', '2023/02/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2023/04/04 06:01 [medline]', '2023/04/03 04:25 [entrez]', '2023/04/04 06:00 [pubmed]'], 'AID': ['10.3389/fped.2023.1102382 [doi]'], 'PST': 'epublish', 'SO': 'Front Pediatr. 2023 Mar 17;11:1102382. doi: 10.3389/fped.2023.1102382. eCollection 2023.'}, {'PMID': '37008547', 'OWN': 'NLM', 'STAT': 'PubMed-not-MEDLINE', 'LR': '20230404', 'IS': '2474-1272 (Electronic) 2474-1264 (Print) 2474-1264 (Linking)', 'VI': '6', 'IP': '3', 'DP': '2022 May-Jun', 'TI': 'Optical Coherence Tomography Angiography: Clinical Utility and Future Directions.', 'PG': '229-242', 'LID': '10.1177/24741264221080376 [doi]', 'AB': 'PURPOSE: This work aims to review the principles of optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA), to survey its clinical utility, and to highlight the strengths of this technology as well as barriers to adoption.

New devices have improved the scanning speed, signal-to-noise ratio, and spatial resolution and offer an increased field of view. New algorithms have been proposed to optimize image processing and reduce artifacts. Numerous studies employing OCTA have been published describing changes to the microvasculature in diabetic retinopathy, age-related macular degeneration, central serous chorioretinopathy, retinal vein occlusion, and uveitis.

The LD combo was continued every 8 weeks (q8w). At week 12, the HD combo was re-randomized to q8w or every 12 weeks (q12w) and IAI was re-randomized to q8w, q12w, or HD combo q8w through week 32. RESULTS: The study comprised 365 eyes. At week 12, the mean best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) gains from baseline were similar in the LD combo group, HD combo group, and IAI group (5.2 letters, 5.6 letters, and 5.4 letters, respectively); the mean central subfield thickness (CST) reductions were similar (182.2 microm, 200.0 microm, and 178.6 microm, respectively). The mean changes in BCVA and CST through week 36 were similar across groups. At week 12, complete retinal fluid resolution was observed in 49.1% (LD combo), 50.8% (HD combo), and 43.6% (IAI) of eyes; the proportions with a CST of 300 mum or less were similar across groups.

Studies have shown that CXCL12 can aggravate inflammatory symptoms in the central nervous system (CNS). Evidence also indicates that CXCL12 can promote the repair of myelin sheaths in the CNS in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). Here, we investigated the function of CXCL12 in CNS inflammation by upregulating CXCL12 in the spinal cord and subsequently inducing EAE. MATERIALS AND METHODS: CXCL12 upregulation in the spinal cords of Lewis rats was induced by the injection of adeno-associated virus 9 (AAV9)/eGFP-P2A-CXCL12 after intrathecal catheter implantation. Twenty-one days after AAV injection, EAE was induced and clinical score was collected; Immunofluorescence staining, WB and LFB-PAS staining were used to evaluate the effect of CXCL12 upregulation. In the in vitro study, oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) were harvested, cultured with CXCL12 and AMD3100, and subjected to immunofluorescence staining for functional assessment. RESULTS: CXCL12 was upregulated in the lumbar enlargement of the spinal cord by AAV injection. In each stage of EAE, upregulation of CXCL12 significantly alleviated clinical scores by inhibiting leukocyte infiltration and promoting remyelination. In contrast, the addition of AMD3100, which is a CXCR4 antagonist, inhibited the effect of CXCL12. In vitro, 10 ng/ml CXCL12 promoted the differentiation of OPCs into oligodendrocytes. CONCLUSION: AAV-mediated upregulation of CXCL12 in the CNS can alleviate the clinical signs and symptoms of EAE and significantly decrease the infiltration of leukocytes in the peak stage of EAE. CXCL12 can promote the maturation and differentiation of OPCs into oligodendrocytes in vitro. These data indicate that CXCL12 effectively promotes remyelination in the spinal cord and decreases the signs and symptoms of EAE.', 'CI': ['Copyright (c) 2023 Lin, Liu, Song, Chen, Fu, Sun, Zhou, Bai, Wei and Li.'], 'FAU': ['Lin, Dahe', 'Liu, Hongjuan', 'Song, Honglu', 'Chen, Biyue', 'Fu, Junxia', 'Sun, Mingming', 'Zhou, Huanfen', 'Bai, Wenhao', 'Wei, Shihui', 'Li, Hongen'], 'AU': ['Lin D', 'Liu H', 'Song H', 'Chen B', 'Fu J', 'Sun M', 'Zhou H', 'Bai W', 'Wei S', 'Li H'], 'AD': [\"Department of Ophthalmology, The First Medical Center of Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) General Hospital, Beijing, China.\", 'Fujian Provincial Key Laboratory of Ecology-Toxicological Effects and Control for Emerging Contaminants, College of Environmental and Biological Engineering, Putian University, Putian, Fujian, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Ecological Environment and Information Atlas, Fujian Provincial University (Putian University), Putian, Fujian, China.', \"Department of Ophthalmology, The First Medical Center of Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) General Hospital, Beijing, China.\", 'Department of Ophthalmology, Beijing Tongren Eye Center, Beijing Tongren Hospital, Beijing, China.', \"Department of Ophthalmology, The First Medical Center of Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) General Hospital, Beijing, China.\", \"Department of Ophthalmology, The 980th Hospital of the Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) Joint Logistics Support Force, Shijiazhuang, Hebei, China.\", \"Department of Ophthalmology, The First Medical Center of Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) General Hospital, Beijing, China.\", \"Department of Ophthalmology, The First Medical Center of Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) General Hospital, Beijing, China.\", \"Department of Ophthalmology, The Third Medical Center of Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) General Hospital, Beijing, China.\", \"Department of Ophthalmology, The First Medical Center of Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) General Hospital, Beijing, China.\", \"Department of Ophthalmology, The First Medical Center of Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) General Hospital, Beijing, China.\", \"Department of Ophthalmology, The First Medical Center of Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) General Hospital, Beijing, China.\", \"Department of Ophthalmology, The First Medical Center of Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) General Hospital, Beijing, China.\"], 'LA': ['eng'], 'PT': ['Journal Article'], 'DEP': '20230316', 'PL': 'Switzerland', 'TA': 'Front Neurosci', 'JT': 'Frontiers in neuroscience', 'JID': '101478481', 'PMC': 'PMC10060838', 'OTO': ['NOTNLM'], 'OT': ['AAV', 'CXCL12', 'EAE', 'neuroinflammation', 'remyelination'], 'COIS': ['The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any', 'commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential', 'conflict of interest.'], 'EDAT': '2023/04/04 06:00', 'MHDA': '2023/04/04 06:01', 'CRDT': ['2023/04/03 04:08'], 'PHST': ['2022/11/22 00:00 [received]', '2023/02/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2023/04/04 06:01 [medline]', '2023/04/03 04:08 [entrez]', '2023/04/04 06:00 [pubmed]'], 'AID': ['10.3389/fnins.2023.1105530 [doi]'], 'PST': 'epublish', 'SO': 'Front Neurosci. 2023 Mar 16;17:1105530. doi: 10.3389/fnins.2023.1105530. eCollection 2023.'}, {'PMID': '37007927', 'OWN': 'NLM', 'STAT': 'PubMed-not-MEDLINE', 'LR': '20230404', 'IS': '2474-1272 (Electronic) 2474-1264 (Print) 2474-1264 (Linking)', 'VI': '6', 'IP': '4', 'DP': '2022 Jul-Aug', 'TI': 'Correlation of Change in Macular Thickness With Change in Visual Acuity in Diabetic Macular Edema: Post Hoc Analysis of VISTA and VIVID Trials.', 'PG': '284-289', 'LID': '10.1177/24741264221099429 [doi]', 'AB': 'Purpose: To assess the correlation between the change in central subfield thickness (CST) and change in best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) in eyes with diabetic macular edema (DME) treated with fixed-dosing intravitreal aflibercept injection (IAI). Methods: This post hoc analysis of the VISTA and VIVID randomized controlled clinical trials, in which 862 eyes with central-involved DME were randomly assigned to IAI 2 mg every 4 weeks (2q4; 290 eyes), IAI 2 mg every 8 weeks after 5 initial monthly doses (2q8; 286 eyes), or macular laser (286 eyes) and followed through 100 weeks. Correlations between the change in CST and change in BCVA from baseline to weeks 12, 52, and 100 were assessed using the Pearson correlation. Results: The respective correlations (r [95% CI]) at weeks 12, 52, and 100 were -0.39 (-0.49 to -0.29), -0.27 (-0.38 to -0.15), and -0.30 (-0.41 to -0.17) in the 2q4 arm and -0.28 (-0.39 to -0.17), -0.29 (-0.41 to -0.17), and -0.33 (-0.44 to -0.20) in the 2q8 arm. Linear regression analysis of the correlation at week 100, adjusted for relevant baseline factors, showed CST changes accounted for 17% of the variance in BCVA changes; every 100-microm decrease in CST was associated with a 1.2-letter increase in BCVA (P = .001). Conclusions: Correlations between the change in CST and change in BCVA after 2q4 or 2q8 fixed-dosing IAI for DME were modest.

Methods: A theoretical model was constructed from the physician's perspective for performing a 90-minute uncomplicated RD surgery with its associated perioperative work in the global period (Current Procedural Terminology code 67108) compared with managing 40 patients per 8-hour clinic day in the equivalent time period. The reimbursement rates were based on the 2019 values set by the US Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS). Sensitivity analyses were performed varying the perioperative times, clinical productivity, and postoperative visits. Results: The CMS physician reimbursement rate for 67108 surgery was 17.13 work relative value units (wRVUs); meanwhile, the physician in the reference case could have generated 40.89 wRVUs in the office. CMS reimbursement therefore represented a 58% opportunity cost relative to lost office productivity for the physician. A significant disparity was still present even when modeling 30 patients per day. In sensitivity analyses, clinical productivity exceeded surgical compensation in 99% of modeled scenarios. In threshold analyses, the surgeon in the reference case would have to complete the surgery and all immediate perioperative care within 18 minutes to equal the total CMS valuation. Conclusions: CMS reimbursement for RD surgery resulted in a significant opportunity cost for the physician relative to office-based patient care, which was more pronounced for more efficient clinicians in the office. The sensitivity analyses supported the robustness of the model. Reductions in surgery reimbursements relative to office-based patient care might disincentivize busy clinicians.\", 'CI': ['(c) The Author(s) 2022.'], 'FAU': ['Leung, Ella H', 'Leder, Henry A', 'Patel, Shriji', 'Reddy, Rahul', 'Boucher, Nick', 'Sharma, Chakshu', 'Blim, Jill', 'Awh, Carl', 'Hahn, Paul'], 'AU': ['Leung EH', 'Leder HA', 'Patel S', 'Reddy R', 'Boucher N', 'Sharma C', 'Blim J', 'Awh C', 'Hahn P'], 'AD': ['Georgia Retina, Atlanta, GA, USA.', 'Leder Retina, Jacksonville, FL, USA.', 'Department of Ophthalmology, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN, USA.', 'Department of Ophthalmology, University of Arizona College of Medicine, Phoenix, AZ, USA.', 'Vestrum Health, Naperville, IL, USA.', 'Vestrum Health, Naperville, IL, USA.', 'American Society of Retina Specialists, Chicago, IL, USA.', 'Tennessee Retina, Nashville, TN, USA.', 'NJRetina, Teaneck, NJ, USA.'], 'AUID': ['ORCID: 0000-0002-6574-388X'], 'CN': ['American Society of Retina Specialists Health Economics Committee'], 'LA': ['eng'], 'PT': ['Journal Article'], 'DEP': '20220716', 'PL': 'United States', 'TA': 'J Vitreoretin Dis', 'JT': 'Journal of vitreoretinal diseases', 'JID': '101700301', 'PMC': 'PMC9976036', 'OTO': ['NOTNLM'], 'OT': ['opportunity cost', 'pars plana vitrectomy', 'relative value units', 'retinal detachment', 'work RVU'], 'COIS': ['The authors declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect to the', 'research, authorship, and/or publication of the article.'], 'EDAT': '2023/04/04 06:00', 'MHDA': '2023/04/04 06:01', 'PMCR': ['2023/07/16'], 'CRDT': ['2023/04/03 04:05'], 'PHST': ['2023/07/16 00:00 [pmc-release]', '2023/04/04 06:01 [medline]', '2023/04/03 04:05 [entrez]', '2023/04/04 06:00 [pubmed]'], 'AID': ['10.1177_24741264221098669 [pii]', '10.1177/24741264221098669 [doi]'], 'PST': 'epublish', 'SO': 'J Vitreoretin Dis. 2022 Jul 16;6(4):278-283. doi: 10.1177/24741264221098669. eCollection 2022 Jul-Aug.'}, {'PMID': '37007786', 'OWN': 'NLM', 'STAT': 'PubMed-not-MEDLINE', 'LR': '20230404', 'IS': '2296-858X (Print) 2296-858X (Electronic) 2296-858X (Linking)', 'VI': '10', 'DP': '2023', 'TI': 'Characteristics of eye-related emergency visits and triage differences by nurses and ophthalmologists: Perspective from a single eye center in southern China.', 'PG': '1091128', 'LID': '10.3389/fmed.2023.1091128 [doi] 1091128', 'AB': 'PURPOSE: To describe characteristics of eye-related emergency department (ED) visits and investigate differences in priorities assigned to patients by triage nurses and ophthalmologists. METHODS: A prospective survey was conducted at the ED of Zhongshan Ophthalmic Center from January 1, 2021, to May 31, 2021. Clinical data from patients with acute ophthalmic conditions lasting less than 7 days were collected via a standard questionnaire and the urgency levels assigned by nurses and physicians were also recorded. Binary logistic regression was performed to identify characteristics associated with truly emergency conditions and up- or down-triage. RESULTS: A total of 1907 patients were enrolled, with 582 (30.5%) classified as \"non-emergency.\" Red eye (69.7%), eye pain (53.0%), ocular trauma (44.1%), tearing (43.6%), and blurred vision (43.1%) were the most common complaints. Truly emergency tended to be male (OR 2.019, p < 0.001) and with unilateral eye involvement (OR 2.992, p < 0.001). Nurses prioritized conjunctival, scleral, closed ocular trauma and eyelid diseases over doctors while giving less priority to open ocular trauma, cornea, uveitis, and vitreoretinal diseases (p < 0.05). Overemphasis on mild blurred vision (OR 3.718, p = 0.001) and insufficient understanding of conjunctival diseases without red eye (OR 0.254, p = 0.001) were associated with conjunctival disease \"up-triage.\" Insufficient awareness of moderate and severe blurred vision was associated with \"down-triage\" for ocular trauma (OR 3.475, p = 0.001 and OR 2.422, p = 0.020, respectively). CONCLUSION: Ophthalmic EDs are typically flooded with patients suffering from acute ocular problems, with a considerable portion for non-emergency conditions.

Investigating the relationship of image conversion factor and imaging centering on retinal vessel geometric characteristics (RVGC), offers solutions for longitudinal retinal vessel analysis for data obtained in clinical routine. METHODS: Retinal vessel geometric characteristics were analyzed in scanned fundus photographs with Singapore-I-Vessel-Assessment using a constant image conversion factor (ICF) and an individual ICF, applying them to macula centered (MC) and optic disk centered (ODC) images. The ICF is used to convert pixel measurements into mum for vessel diameter measurements and to establish the size of the measuring zone. Calculating a constant ICF, the width of all analyzed optic disks is included, and it is used for all images of a cohort. An individual ICF, in turn, uses the optic disk diameter of the eye analyzed. To investigate agreement, Bland-Altman mean difference was calculated between ODC images analyzed with individual and constant ICF and between MC and ODC images. RESULTS: With constant ICF (n = 104 eyes of 52 patients) the mean central retinal equivalent was 160.9 +/- 17.08 mum for arteries (CRAE) and 208.7 +/- 14.7.4 mum for veins (CRVE). The individual ICFs resulted in a mean CRAE of 163.3 +/- 15.6 mum and a mean CRVE of 219.0 +/- 22.3 mum. On Bland-Altman analysis, the individual ICF RVGC are more positive, resulting in a positive mean difference for most investigated parameters. Arteriovenous ratio (p = 0.86), simple tortuosity (p = 0.08), and fractal dimension (p = 0.80) agreed well between MC and ODC images, while the vessel diameters were significantly smaller in MC images (p < 0.002). CONCLUSION: Scanned images can be analyzed using vessel assessment software. Investigations of individual ICF versus constant ICF point out the asset of utilizing an individual ICF. Image settings (ODC vs. MC) were shown to have good agreement.', 'CI': ['Copyright (c) 2023 Schanner, Hautala, Rauscher and Falck.'], 'FAU': ['Schanner, Carolin', 'Hautala, Nina', 'Rauscher, Franziska G', 'Falck, Aura'], 'AU': ['Schanner C', 'Hautala N', 'Rauscher FG', 'Falck A'], 'AD': ['Department of Ophthalmology and Medical Research Center, Oulu University Hospital, Oulu, Finland.', 'PEDEGO Research Unit, University of Oulu, Oulu, Finland.', 'Institute for Medical Informatics, Statistics, and Epidemiology, Leipzig University, Leipzig, Germany.', 'Department of Ophthalmology and Medical Research Center, Oulu University Hospital, Oulu, Finland.', 'PEDEGO Research Unit, University of Oulu, Oulu, Finland.', 'Institute for Medical Informatics, Statistics, and Epidemiology, Leipzig University, Leipzig, Germany.', 'Department of Ophthalmology and Medical Research Center, Oulu University Hospital, Oulu, Finland.', 'PEDEGO Research Unit, University of Oulu, Oulu, Finland.'], 'LA': ['eng'], 'PT': ['Journal Article'], 'DEP': '20230317', 'PL': 'Switzerland', 'TA': 'Front Med (Lausanne)', 'JT': 'Frontiers in medicine', 'JID': '101648047', 'PMC': 'PMC10063888', 'OTO': ['NOTNLM'], 'OT': ['diabetic retinopathy', 'ophthalmology', 'retina', 'retinal image analysis', 'retinal microvasculature', 'retinal vessel geometric characteristics (RVGC)', 'retinal vessel parameter'], 'COIS': ['The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any', 'commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential', 'conflict of interest.'], 'EDAT': '2023/04/04 06:00', 'MHDA': '2023/04/04 06:01', 'CRDT': ['2023/04/03 04:03'], 'PHST': ['2022/11/30 00:00 [received]', '2023/03/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2023/04/04 06:01 [medline]', '2023/04/03 04:03 [entrez]', '2023/04/04 06:00 [pubmed]'], 'AID': ['10.3389/fmed.2023.1112652 [doi]'], 'PST': 'epublish', 'SO': 'Front Med (Lausanne). 2023 Mar 17;10:1112652. doi: 10.3389/fmed.2023.1112652. eCollection 2023.'}, {'PMID': '37007646', 'OWN': 'NLM', 'STAT': 'PubMed-not-MEDLINE', 'LR': '20230404', 'IS': '2666-9145 (Electronic) 2666-9145 (Linking)', 'VI': '3', 'IP': '3', 'DP': '2023 Sep', 'TI': 'No Strong Association between the Apolipoprotein E E4 Allele and Glaucoma: A Multicohort Study.', 'PG': '100287', 'LID': '10.1016/j.xops.2023.100287 [doi] 100287', 'AB': \"PURPOSE: To elucidate a potential association between the apolipoprotein E (APOE) E4 allele and glaucoma prevalence in large cohorts. DESIGN: A cross-sectional analysis of baseline and prospectively collected cohort data. PARTICIPANTS: UK Biobank (UKBB) participants of genetically determined European ancestry (n = 438 711). Replication analyses were performed using clinical and genotyping data collected from European participants recruited to the Canadian Longitudinal Study of Aging (CLSA; n = 18 199), the Australian and New Zealand Registry of Advanced Glaucoma (ANZRAG; n = 1970), and the Blue Mountains Eye Study (BMES; n = 2440). METHODS: Apolipoprotein E alleles and genotypes were determined, and their distributions were compared on the basis of glaucoma status. Similar analyses were performed using positive control outcomes associated with the APOE E4 allele (death, dementia, age-related macular degeneration) and negative control outcomes not associated with the APOE E4 allele (cataract, diabetic eye disease). Outcome phenotypes were also correlated with Alzheimer's dementia (AD), a clinical outcome highly associated with the APOE E4 allele. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Results of APOE E4 genotype-phenotype comparisons were reported as odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Replication analyses investigated APOE E4 associations in 2 replication cohorts (CLSA and ANZRAG/BMES). RESULTS: The APOE E4 allele was inversely associated with glaucoma (OR, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.93-0.99; P = 0.016) and both negative controls (cataract: OR, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.96-0.99; P = 0.015; diabetic eye disease: OR, 0.92; 95% CI, 0.87-0.97; P = 0.003) in the UKBB cohort. A paradoxical positive association was observed between AD and both glaucoma (OR, 1.30; 95% CI, 1.08-1.54; P < 0.01) and cataract (OR, 1.15; 1.04-1.28; P = 0.018). No association between the APOE E4 allele and glaucoma was observed in either replication cohort (CLSA: OR, 1.03; 95% CI, 0.89-1.19; P = 0.66; ANZRAG/BMES: OR, 0.97; 95% CI, 0.84-1.12; P = 0.65). CONCLUSIONS: A small negative association observed between APOE E4 and glaucoma within the UKBB was not evident in either replication cohort and may represent an artifact of glaucoma underdiagnosis in APOE E4 carriers.

METHODS: Retrospective, record-based analysis of 54 eyes belonging to 27 adult patients that fulfilled the revised diagnostic criteria for VKH between January 2018 and January 2021. Demographic, clinical, and imaging data on presentation and during follow-up visits were collected for each patient. Available imaging studies included B-scan ultrasonography (B-scan US), spectral domain optical coherence tomography (OCT), fundus fluorescein angiography (FFA), and OCT angiography (OCT-A). RESULTS: The female-to-male ratio was 2.38:1. Nineteen patients (70.37%) presented during an initial attack, while eight patients (29.63%) presented during recurrence. The most commonly presenting sign in the posterior segment was exudative retinal detachment (44 eyes, 81.48%). B-scan US was utilized in 4 eyes (7.41%), OCT was utilized in 48 eyes (88.89%) with the most common finding being subretinal fluid (43 eyes, 89.58%), FFA was performed in 39 eyes (72.22%) with the most common finding being punctate hyperfluorescence and late dye pooling (33 eyes, 84.62%), and OCT-A was performed in 30 eyes (55.56%), in which choriocapillaris flow deficit that correlated with disease activity was detectable in 25 eyes (83.33%). Improved visual acuity was noted in 85% of the eyes that were followed up. CONCLUSION: Early diagnosis and treatment of VKH result in favorable visual outcome.

A 25-year-old male attended at outpatient department of chittagong eye infirmary and training complex institute with a history of a sudden loss of vision in the left eye for 20 days. On eye examination, the patient had reduced visual acuity on the left eye (6/60), and the left pupil showed a relative afferent pupillary defect and swollen left optic disc. No other abnormalities were found in a routine blood test and magnetic resonance imaging of the brain. Intravenous corticosteroid was administered for 3 days followed by oral corticosteroid. His vision was gradually improving within a month and became 6/9 in the left eye, but after a month, the patient returned with the blurring of vision in the same eye for 3 days. An extensive serum biochemical and serological test and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis was done including syphilis serology and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) serology. Venereal disease research laboratory (VDRL) test and Treponema pallidum hemagglutination assay (TPHA) were found positive with high titer (1:1280) and rapid plasma reagin (RPR) titer of 1:64 in blood. The CSF analysis showed leukocytosis, and VDRL and TPHA were also found positive with high RPR titer. The HIV serology test was negative. The patient was treated with injectable ceftriaxone 2 g intravenously for 14 days and also injectable corticosteroid. His vision was improved within this period. Unilateral optic neuritis due to syphilis without other ocular features is uncommon but should be considered if a patient presents with visual loss and optic disc swelling.

Methods: Data of patients 18 years or younger who had surgical repair for RRD from January 1, 2004, to June 31, 2020, with a minimum of 6 months of follow-up were retrospectively analyzed. Results: The study evaluated 101 eyes of 94 patients. Of the eyes, 90% had at least 1 predisposing factor to pediatric RRD, including trauma (46%), myopia (41%), prior intraocular surgery (26%), and congenital anomaly (23%); 81% had macula-off detachments and 34% had proliferative vitreoretinopathy (PVR) grade C or worse at presentation. The presence of PVR grade C or worse (P = .0002), total RRD (P = .014), and vitrectomy alone at first surgery (P = .0093) were associated with worse outcomes.

Methods: In this case series, a new finding (TelCaps) was seen on clinical examination, fundus evaluation, fluorescein angiography, ICGA, and optical coherence tomography (OCT). Results: This series comprised 3 patients with TelCaps findings on ICGA after retinal vascular occlusions. The patients' ages ranged from 52 years to 71 years and the best-corrected visual acuity in the affected eye, from 20/25 to 20/80. Fundus evaluation showed small, hard exudates in the vascular termination close to the macula with a reduction of the foveal reflex. The OCT images showed marginal hyperreflectivity and inner hyporeflectivity that were suggestive of a TelCaps lesion, which was confirmed by hyperfluorescence in the late phase of ICGA. Conclusions: This study highlights the importance of performing multimodal imaging evaluation, including ICGA, in eyes with retinal vein occlusions for early identification and management of the associated lesions.\", 'CI': ['(c) The Author(s) 2023.'], 'FAU': ['De Oliveira, Marcela R V', 'Mota, Isabela', 'Higino, Taciana Mm', 'Ventura, Camila V', 'Japiassu, R M', 'Gantois, Michelle'], 'AU': ['De Oliveira MRV', 'Mota I', 'Higino TM', 'Ventura CV', 'Japiassu RM', 'Gantois M'], 'AD': ['Department of Ophthalmology, Altino Ventura Foundation, Pernambuco, Brazil.', 'Department of Ophthalmology, Altino Ventura Foundation, Pernambuco, Brazil.', 'Research Department, Altino Ventura Foundation, Pernambuco, Brazil.', 'Department of Ophthalmology, Altino Ventura Foundation, Pernambuco, Brazil.', 'Research Department, Altino Ventura Foundation, Pernambuco, Brazil.', 'Department of Ophthalmology, HOPE Hospital, Pernambuco, Brazil.', 'Pontificia Universidade Catolica, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.', 'Department of Ophthalmology, Altino Ventura Foundation, Pernambuco, Brazil.', 'Department of Ophthalmology, HOPE Hospital, Pernambuco, Brazil.'], 'LA': ['eng'], 'PT': ['Journal Article'], 'DEP': '20230216', 'PL': 'United States', 'TA': 'J Vitreoretin Dis', 'JT': 'Journal of vitreoretinal diseases', 'JID': '101700301', 'PMC': 'PMC10037749', 'OTO': ['NOTNLM'], 'OT': ['microaneurysm', 'retina', 'retinal vein', 'retinal vein occlusion', 'retinal vessels', 'telangiectasia'], 'COIS': ['The author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect to the', 'research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.'], 'EDAT': '2023/04/04 06:00', 'MHDA': '2023/04/04 06:01', 'PMCR': ['2024/02/16'], 'CRDT': ['2023/04/03 03:49'], 'PHST': ['2024/02/16 00:00 [pmc-release]', '2023/04/04 06:01 [medline]', '2023/04/03 03:49 [entrez]', '2023/04/04 06:00 [pubmed]'], 'AID': ['10.1177_24741264221149295 [pii]', '10.1177/24741264221149295 [doi]'], 'PST': 'epublish', 'SO': 'J Vitreoretin Dis. 2023 Feb 16;7(2):154-159. doi: 10.1177/24741264221149295. eCollection 2023 Mar-Apr.'}, {'PMID': '37006665', 'OWN': 'NLM', 'STAT': 'PubMed-not-MEDLINE', 'LR': '20230404', 'IS': '2474-1272 (Electronic) 2474-1264 (Print) 2474-1264 (Linking)', 'VI': '7', 'IP': '2', 'DP': '2023 Mar-Apr', 'TI': 'Intraocular Methotrexate for the Treatment and Prevention of Proliferative Vitreoretinopathy: A Review.', 'PG': '144-153', 'LID': '10.1177/24741264221135799 [doi]', 'AB': 'PURPOSE: To review the current literature on the use of intravitreal methotrexate (IVT MTX) for the treatment and prevention of proliferative vitreoretinopathy (PVR). METHODS: All reports of IVT MTX to treat and prevent PVR published in PubMed, Google Scholar, and EBSCOhost were reviewed. The relevant current studies are included in this report. RESULTS: The literature search yielded 32 articles describing the use of MTX in PVR. These included preclinical studies, 1 case report, and several case series. Early studies found that IVT MTX is a promising medication for the treatment and prevention of PVR. MTX works as a potent anti-inflammatory agent through a new mechanism of action different from that of other medications for use in PVR. Few side effects have been reported and were mostly limited to mild reversible corneal keratopathy. There are 2 current ongoing randomized controlled clinical trials to further evaluate the efficacy of MTX for PVR. CONCLUSIONS: MTX is a safe and potentially efficacious medication for the treatment and prevention of PVR. Additional clinical trials are needed to further establish this effect.', 'CI': ['(c) The Author(s) 2022.'], 'FAU': ['McAllister, Mark A', 'Moore, Spencer M', 'Bullock, Brenna', 'Christoforidis, John B'], 'AU': ['McAllister MA', 'Moore SM', 'Bullock B', 'Christoforidis JB'], 'AUID': ['ORCID: 0000-0002-2020-4196', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-0240-5963'], 'AD': ['Department of Ophthalmology & Vision Science, University of Arizona College of Medicine, Tucson, AZ, USA.', 'Department of Ophthalmology & Vision Science, University of Arizona College of Medicine, Tucson, AZ, USA.', 'Department of Ophthalmology & Vision Science, University of Arizona College of Medicine, Tucson, AZ, USA.', 'Department of Ophthalmology & Vision Science, University of Arizona College of Medicine, Tucson, AZ, USA.', 'Retina Specialists of Southern Arizona, Tucson, AZ, USA.'], 'LA': ['eng'], 'PT': ['Journal Article', 'Review'], 'DEP': '20221210', 'PL': 'United States', 'TA': 'J Vitreoretin Dis', 'JT': 'Journal of vitreoretinal diseases', 'JID': '101700301', 'PMC': 'PMC10037751', 'OTO': ['NOTNLM'], 'OT': ['IVT MTX', 'IVT methotrexate', 'PVR', 'intra-silicone methotrexate', 'intraocular methotrexate', 'intravitreal methotrexate', 'methotrexate', 'proliferative vitreoretinopathy'], 'COIS': ['The author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect to the', 'research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.'], 'EDAT': '2023/04/04 06:00', 'MHDA': '2023/04/04 06:01', 'PMCR': ['2023/12/10'], 'CRDT': ['2023/04/03 03:49'], 'PHST': ['2023/12/10 00:00 [pmc-release]', '2023/04/04 06:01 [medline]', '2023/04/03 03:49 [entrez]', '2023/04/04 06:00 [pubmed]'], 'AID': ['10.1177_24741264221135799 [pii]', '10.1177/24741264221135799 [doi]'], 'PST': 'epublish', 'SO': 'J Vitreoretin Dis. 2022 Dec 10;7(2):144-153. doi: 10.1177/24741264221135799. eCollection 2023 Mar-Apr.'}, {'PMID': '37006552', 'OWN': 'NLM', 'STAT': 'MEDLINE', 'DCOM': '20230405', 'LR': '20230405', 'IS': '2296-2565 (Electronic) 2296-2565 (Linking)', 'VI': '11', 'DP': '2023', 'TI': 'Sensory impairments and subjective well-being status in middle-aged and older Chinese population: Cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses of a nationally representative survey.', 'PG': '1099754', 'LID': '10.3389/fpubh.2023.1099754 [doi] 1099754', 'AB': 'PURPOSE: To investigate the impacts of sensory impairments (SIs) including single vision impairment (SVI), single hearing impairment (SHI) and dual sensory impairment (DSI) on subjective wellbeing measurements including life expectancy (LE), life satisfaction (LS) and self-rated health (SRH) in middle-aged and older Chinese population. METHODS: We obtained data from the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Survey (CHARLS). In total, 9,293 Chinese middle-aged and older adults aging over 45 were included at baseline 2011 in this study, and 3,932 participants who accomplished all 4 interviews from 2011 to 2018 were adapted for longitudinal analyses. Sensory status and subjective wellbeing measurements were collected. Other covariates included socio-demographic characteristics, medical condition and lifestyle-related factors. The impacts of baseline sensory status on LE, LS and SRH were assessed using univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses. A linear regression analysis with generalized estimating equations (GEE) was used to assess the association between time-varying sensory statuses with LE, LS and SRH over 8 years after being adjusted with multi-confounding factors. RESULTS: Participants with SIs had significantly lower level of LE, LS, and SRH, compared to those who were free of SI. All kinds of SIs were significantly associated with LE, LS, and SRH according to cross-sectional data. The correlations between SIs and LE or SRH over 8 years were also noticed. However, only SHI and DSI were found to be significantly associated with LS according to longitudinal data (all p values < 0.05).

expressions that are different from those of healthy individuals due to the combination of somatic and psychiatric symptoms. However, the facial expressions of GO patients have not yet been described and analyzed systematically. Thus, the present study aimed to present the facial expressions of GO patients and explore their applications in clinical practice. METHODS: Facial image and clinical data of 943 GO patients were included, and 126 patients answered quality of life (GO-QOL) questionnaires. Each patient was labeled for one facial expression. Then, a portrait was drawn for every facial expression. Logistic and linear regression was performed to analyze the correlation between facial expression and clinical indicators, including QOL, disease activity and severity. The VGG-19 network model was utilized to discriminate facial expressions automatically. RESULTS: Two groups, i.e., the non-negative emotion (neutral, happy) and the negative emotion (disgust, angry, fear, sadness, surprise), and seven expressions of GO patients were systematically analyzed. Facial expression was statistically associated with GO activity (P = 0.002), severity (P < 0.001), QOL visual functioning subscale scores (P = 0.001), and QOL appearance subscale score (P = 0.012). The deep learning model achieved satisfactory results (accuracy 0.851, sensitivity 0.899, precision 0.899, specificity 0.720, F1 score 0.899, and AUC 0.847).

Stromal cells can adopt new phenotypes to promote tumor cell invasion. A deep understanding of the signaling pathways involved in cell-to-cell and cell-to-ECM interactions is needed to design effective intervention strategies that might interrupt these interactions. In this review, we describe the tumor microenvironment (TME) components and associated therapeutics. We discuss the clinical advances in the prevalent and newly discovered signaling pathways in the TME, the immune checkpoints and immunosuppressive chemokines, and currently used inhibitors targeting these pathways. These include both intrinsic and non-autonomous tumor cell signaling pathways in the TME: protein kinase C (PKC) signaling, Notch, and transforming growth factor (TGF-beta) signaling, Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER) stress response, lactate signaling, Metabolic reprogramming, cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS)-stimulator of interferon genes (STING) and Siglec signaling pathways. We also discuss the recent advances in Programmed Cell Death Protein 1 (PD-1), Cytotoxic T-Lymphocyte Associated Protein 4 (CTLA4), T-cell immunoglobulin mucin-3 (TIM-3) and Lymphocyte Activating Gene 3 (LAG3) immune checkpoint inhibitors along with the C-C chemokine receptor 4 (CCR4)- C-C class chemokines 22 (CCL22)/ and 17 (CCL17), C-C chemokine receptor type 2 (CCR2)- chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 2 (CCL2), C-C chemokine receptor type 5 (CCR5)- chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 3 (CCL3) chemokine signaling axis in the TME. In addition, this review provides a holistic understanding of the TME as we discuss the three-dimensional and microfluidic models of the TME, which are believed to recapitulate the original characteristics of the patient tumor and hence may be used as a platform to study new mechanisms and screen for various anti-cancer therapies. We further discuss the systemic influences of gut microbiota in TME reprogramming and treatment response. Overall, this review provides a comprehensive analysis of the diverse and most critical signaling pathways in the TME, highlighting the associated newest and critical preclinical and clinical studies along with their underlying biology. We highlight the importance of the most recent technologies of microfluidics and lab-on-chip models for TME research and also present an overview of extrinsic factors, such as the inhabitant human microbiome, which have the potential to modulate TME biology and drug responses.', 'CI': ['(c) 2023 The Authors.

Potential targets of active components were retrieved from SwissTargetPrediction. RVO-related targets were acquired from related disease databases. Core targets of SQWMG against RVO were acquired by overlapping the above targets. The 66 components (including 5 isomers) and 169 targets were obtained and concluded into a component-target network. Together with biological enrichment analysis of targets, it revealed the crucial role of the \"PI3K-Akt signaling pathway\", \"MAPK signaling pathway\" and their downstream factor iNOS and TNF-alpha. The 20 key targets of SQWMG in treating RVO were acquired from the network and pathway analysis. The effects of SQWMG on targets and pathways were validated by molecular docking based on AutoDock Vina and qPCR experiment. The molecular docking showed great affinity for these components and targets, especially on ganoderic acids (GA) and alisols (AS), which were both triterpenoids and qPCR exhibited remarkably reduced inflammatory factor gene expression through regulation of these two pathways.

This study aimed to investigate the metabolite profile of aqueous humor (AH) in patients with ME of different etiologies and identify potential metabolite biomarkers for early diagnosis of ME. METHODS: Samples of AH were collected from 60 patients with ME and 20 age- and sex-matched controls and analyzed by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC/MS)-based metabolomics. A series of univariate and multivariate statistical analyses were performed to identify differential metabolites and enriched metabolite pathways. RESULTS: The metabolic profile of AH differed significantly between ME patients and healthy controls, and differentially expressed metabolites were identified. Pathway analysis revealed that these differentially expressed metabolites are mainly involved in lipid metabolism and amino acid metabolism. Moreover, significant differences were identified in the metabolic composition of AH from patients with ME due to different retinal diseases including age-related macular degeneration (AMD-ME), diabetic retinopathy (DME) and branch retinal vein occlusion (BRVO-ME). In total, 39 and 79 etiology-specific altered metabolites were identified for AMD-ME and DME, respectively. Finally, an AH-derived machine learning-based diagnostic model was developed and successfully validated in the test cohort with an area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve of 0.79 for AMD-ME, 0.94 for DME and 0.77 for BRVO-ME. CONCLUSIONS: Our study illustrates the potential underlying metabolic basis of AH of different etiologies across ME populations. We also identify AH-derived metabolite biomarkers that may improve the differential diagnosis and treatment stratification of ME patients with different etiologies.', 'CI': ['(c) 2023.

Nevertheless, aeroallergens can trigger respiratory symptoms not only in atopic patients (atopic respiratory allergy, ARA), but also in non-atopic subjects (local respiratory allergy, LRA). Moreover, ARA and LRA can coexist in the same patient, and this clinical scenario has been called dual respiratory allergy (DRA). When the clinical history cannot determine the relevance of sensitizations in ARA patients, nasal, conjunctival or bronchial allergen challenges (NAC, CAC and BAC, respectively) should be conducted. Moreover, these tests are required to identify patients with LRA and DRA. The clarification of the allergic triggers of airway diseases has a profound impact on the management strategies the patients can be offered. Importantly, allergen immunotherapy (AIT) remains as the only disease-modifying intervention for ARA. Recent data indicate that AIT might have a similar effect on LRA patients. Nevertheless, AIT success relies largely on the correct phenotyping of allergic individuals, and NAC, CAC and BAC are very helpful tools in this regard.

In this report, we describe the role of IS in the translational research spectrum, provide a summary of sessions from the 2022 Midwest Clinical & Translational Research Meeting, and highlight initiatives to complement national efforts to build capacity for IS through the annual meetings.', 'FAU': ['Scanzera, Angelica C', 'Nyenhuis, Sharmilee M', 'Rudd, Brittany N', 'Ramaswamy, Megha', 'Mazzucca, Stephanie', 'Castro, Mario', 'Kennedy, David J', 'Mermelstein, Robin J', 'Chambers, David A', 'Dudek, Steven M', 'Krishnan, Jerry A'], 'AU': ['Scanzera AC', 'Nyenhuis SM', 'Rudd BN', 'Ramaswamy M', 'Mazzucca S', 'Castro M', 'Kennedy DJ', 'Mermelstein RJ', 'Chambers DA', 'Dudek SM', 'Krishnan JA'], 'AD': ['Department of Ophthalmology and Visual Sciences, Illinois Eye and Ear Infirmary, University of Illinois Chicago, Chicago, IL, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, University of Chicago, Chicago, IL, USA.', 'Institute for Juvenile Research, University of Illinois Chicago, Chicago, IL, USA.', 'KU Medical Center, University of Kansas, Kansas City, KS, USA.', 'Brown School, Washington University in St Louis, St Louis, MO, USA.', 'KU Medical Center, University of Kansas, Kansas City, KS, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Toledo College of Medicine and Life Sciences, Toledo, OH, USA.', 'Institute for Health Research and Policy, University of Illinois Chicago, Chicago, IL, USA.', 'Division of Cancer Control and Population Sciences, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Illinois Chicago, Chicago, IL, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Illinois Chicago, Chicago, IL, USA.', 'Population Health Sciences Program, University of Illinois Chicago, Chicago, IL, USA.'], 'LA': ['eng'], 'PT': ['Journal Article'], 'DEP': '20230331', 'PL': 'England', 'TA': 'J Investig Med', 'JT': 'Journal of investigative medicine : the official publication of the American Federation for Clinical Research', 'JID': '9501229', 'SB': 'IM', 'OTO': ['NOTNLM'], 'OT': ['Translational medical research', 'diabetes mellitus', 'diabetic retinopathy', 'implementation science'], 'EDAT': '2023/04/02 06:00', 'MHDA': '2023/04/02 06:00', 'CRDT': ['2023/04/01 01:52'], 'PHST': ['2023/04/01 01:52 [entrez]', '2023/04/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2023/04/02 06:00 [medline]'], 'AID': ['10.1177/10815589231166102 [doi]'], 'PST': 'aheadofprint', 'SO': 'J Investig Med. 2023 Mar 31:10815589231166102. doi: 10.1177/10815589231166102.'}, {'PMID': '37002599', 'OWN': 'NLM', 'STAT': 'Publisher', 'LR': '20230405', 'IS': '1096-9861 (Electronic) 0021-9967 (Linking)', 'DP': '2023 Mar 31', 'TI': 'Expression of alpha-Synuclein in the mouse retina is confined to inhibitory presynaptic elements.', 'LID': '10.1002/cne.25481 [doi]', 'AB': \"alpha-Synuclein (alpha-Syn) is enriched in presynaptic terminals of the central nervous system including the retina and plays a role in the synaptic vesicle cycle and synaptic transmission. Abnormal aggregation of alpha-Syn is considered to be the main component of the Lewy bodies that are the pathological hallmarks of Parkinson's disease. Although expression pattern of alpha-Syn has been described in the retinas, its precise cellular and subcellular locations are poorly understood. We investigated the precise expression of alpha-Syn using light microscopy (LM) and electron microscopy (EM) with antibodies against alpha-Syn in the mouse retina. We found that the majority of alpha-Syn immunoreactivity (IR) is located in GABAergic, glycinergic, and dopaminergic amacrine cells, and their processes often make a direct synapse to other labeled or unlabeled amacrine profiles, bipolar cell terminals, or ganglion cell dendrites. Further, our LM and immuno-EM results confirm the absence of alpha-Syn in excitatory photoreceptors, bipolar cell bodies, and their ribbon synapses, providing evidence, for the first time, that ribbon synapses do not express alpha-Syn. Additionally, alpha-Syn IR is located in the ganglion cells, some of which are intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells. These results reveal a previously unappreciated inhibitory synapse-specific expression pattern of alpha-Syn in the retina, suggesting that alpha-Syn may play a distinct role in the modulation and integration of inhibitory synaptic transmission in the retina.\", 'CI': ['(c) 2023 Wiley Periodicals LLC.'], 'FAU': ['Yang, Qingwen', 'Lin, Xin', 'Xiao, Jiayi', 'Zhong, Wenhui', 'Wang, Fenglan', 'Tan, Hang', 'Rao, Bilin', 'Qu, Jia', 'Zhang, Jun'], 'AU': ['Yang Q', 'Lin X', 'Xiao J', 'Zhong W', 'Wang F', 'Tan H', 'Rao B', 'Qu J', 'Zhang J'], 'AD': ['Laboratory of Retinal Physiology and Disease, School of Ophthalmology and Optometry and Eye Hospital, Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou, China.', 'Laboratory of Retinal Physiology and Disease, School of Ophthalmology and Optometry and Eye Hospital, Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou, China.', 'Laboratory of Retinal Physiology and Disease, School of Ophthalmology and Optometry and Eye Hospital, Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou, China.', 'Laboratory of Retinal Physiology and Disease, School of Ophthalmology and Optometry and Eye Hospital, Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou, China.', 'Laboratory of Retinal Physiology and Disease, School of Ophthalmology and Optometry and Eye Hospital, Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou, China.', 'Laboratory of Retinal Physiology and Disease, School of Ophthalmology and Optometry and Eye Hospital, Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou, China.', 'Laboratory of Retinal Physiology and Disease, School of Ophthalmology and Optometry and Eye Hospital, Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Ophthalmology, Optometry and Vision Science, Eye Hospital, Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou, China.', 'National Clinical Research Center for Ocular Diseases, Eye Hospital, Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou, China.', 'Laboratory of Retinal Physiology and Disease, School of Ophthalmology and Optometry and Eye Hospital, Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Ophthalmology, Optometry and Vision Science, Eye Hospital, Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou, China.', 'National Clinical Research Center for Ocular Diseases, Eye Hospital, Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou, China.'], 'AUID': ['ORCID: 0000-0002-4796-8479'], 'LA': ['eng'], 'GR': ['89219003/Start-up Foundation of Wenzhou Medical University/', '4241320001G/State Key Laboratory of Ophthalmology, Optometry and Visual Science/', 'LY21H120004/Zhejiang Provincial Natural Science Foundation of China/', 'Y20190168/Wenzhou Natural Science Foundation of China/'], 'PT': ['Journal Article'], 'DEP': '20230331', 'PL': 'United States', 'TA': 'J Comp Neurol', 'JT': 'The Journal of comparative neurology', 'JID': '0406041', 'SB': 'IM', 'OTO': ['NOTNLM'], 'OT': ['amacrine cells', 'excitatory ribbon synapses', 'inhibitory synapses', 'retina', 'alpha-Synuclein'], 'EDAT': '2023/04/02 06:00', 'MHDA': '2023/04/02 06:00', 'CRDT': ['2023/04/01 01:32'], 'PHST': ['2023/01/18 00:00 [revised]', '2022/08/29 00:00 [received]', '2023/03/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2023/04/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2023/04/02 06:00 [medline]', '2023/04/01 01:32 [entrez]'], 'AID': ['10.1002/cne.25481 [doi]'], 'PST': 'aheadofprint', 'SO': 'J Comp Neurol. 2023 Mar 31. doi: 10.1002/cne.25481.'}, {'PMID': '37001972', 'OWN': 'NLM', 'STAT': 'Publisher', 'LR': '20230331', 'IS': '1468-2079 (Electronic) 0007-1161 (Linking)', 'DP': '2023 Mar 31', 'TI': 'Distribution and determinants of choroidal vascularity index in healthy eyes from deep-learning choroidal analysis: a population-based SS-OCT study.', 'LID': 'bjo-2023-323224 [pii] 10.1136/bjo-2023-323224 [doi]', 'AB': 'AIMS: To quantify the profiles of choroidal vascularity index (CVI) using fully artificial intelligence (AI)-based algorithm applied to swept-source optical coherence tomography (SS-OCT) images and evaluate the determinants of CVI in a population-based study. METHODS: This cross-sectional study included adults aged >/=35 years residing in the Yuexiu District of Guangzhou, China, a follow-up population-based study. All participants (n=646) underwent comprehensive ophthalmic examinations, including SS-OCT for quantifying choroidal parameters. The CVI and subfoveal choroidal thickness (SFCT) were measured by a novel AI-based system. RESULTS: A total of 556 participants were included, with a mean age of 56.4+/-9.9 years and 44.96% women. The average CVI and SFCT of the overall population were 69.7% (95% CI 69.2 to 70.3) and 263.0 microm (95% CI 257.2 to 268.8), respectively. After adjusting for other factors, older age and longer AL were significantly associated with a lower CVI. The CVI decreased by -0.13% (-0.19 to -0.06, p<0.001) with each 1-year increase in age, -2.10% (-3.29 to -0.92, p=0.001) with each 1 mm increase in AL. Furthermore, significantly positive correlation between CVI and SFCT has been observed, with coefficient of 0.059 (0.052 to 0.065, p<0.001). CONCLUSION: Using new AI-based choroidal segmentation software, we provided a fast, reliable and objective CVI profile for large-scale samples. Older age and longer AL were independent correlates of choroidal thinning and CVI decline. These factors should be considered when interpreting SS-OCT-based choroidal measurements.', 'CI': ['(c) Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2023. No commercial re-use. See rights and', 'permissions.

Most such mutations consist of missense variants. METHODS: In this study, we present a precision medicine workflow combining next-generation sequencing (NGS) diagnostics, molecular etiology analysis, and personalized drug discovery. FINDINGS: We describe a patient carrying a de novo intronic mutation (NM_020988.3:c.724-8G>A), leading to epilepsy-negative encephalopathy with motor dysfunction from the second decade. Our data show that this mutation creates a novel splice acceptor site that in turn causes an in-frame insertion of two amino acid residues, Pro-Gln, within the regulatory switch III region of Galphao. This insertion misconfigures the switch III loop and creates novel interactions with the catalytic switch II region, resulting in increased GTP uptake, defective GTP hydrolysis, and aberrant interactions with effector proteins. In contrast, intracellular localization, Gbetagamma interactions, and G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) coupling of the Galphao[insPQ] mutant protein remain unchanged. CONCLUSIONS: This in-depth analysis characterizes the heterozygous c.724-8G>A mutation as partially dominant negative, providing clues to the molecular etiology of this specific pathology. Further, this analysis allows us to establish and validate a high-throughput screening platform aiming at identifying molecules that could correct the aberrant biochemical functions of the mutant Galphao.

METHODS: Patients who had KLAL for MGK with or without corneal transplantation between 2002 and 2016 were recalled to be enrolled in this retrospective interventional case series. The primary outcome was the success rate of the KLAL demonstrated by Kaplan-Meier cumulative survival analysis. The secondary outcomes were postoperative BCVA and the need for further surgery. RESULTS: A total of 108 eyes of 68 patients with MGK underwent KLAL. All patients were male with an average age of 54 +/- 6 years with an average follow-up duration of 81.9 +/- 38.4 months. Sectoral KLAL alone was performed in 62 eyes (57.4%), combined with lamellar keratoplasty (LKP) in 40 eyes (37%) and combined with penetrating keratoplasty in 6 eyes (5.6%). The cumulative probability of success was 75% within the follow-up duration. The mean duration of successful KLAL survival was 80.6 +/- 38 months. 88.1% of these eyes needed only 1 operation to stabilize the ocular surface. Average BCVA did not improve significantly after KLAL alone, except in those accompanied by keratoplasty. KLAL combined with LKP achieved the superior clinical outcome compared with KLAL alone.

Herein, we described a novel hybrid vaccine \"MCL\" (Melittin-RADA(32)-CpG-Lysate) which was composed of melittin, RADA(32), CpG and tumor lysate.

MCL showed excellent ability for sustained drug release, to activate dendritic cells and directly kill melanoma cells in vitro. In vivo, MCL not only exerted direct antitumor activity, but also had robust immune initiation effects including the activation of dendritic cells in draining lymph nodes and the infiltration of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) in tumor microenvironment.

However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the improvement of metabolic health following this process warrants more investigation. This study investigates LSG-related molecules and uses bulk RNA-sequencing high-throughput analysis to unravel their regulatory mechanisms. METHODS: Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were collected from ten obese patients with BMI >/= 32.5 kg/m(2) in the Department of General Surgery of Kunming First People's Hospital. After LSG, patients were followed up for one month, and blood samples were retaken. Blood samples from ten patients before and after LSG and bulk RNA-Seq data were analyzed in this study. LSG-associated gene expression was detected by weighted gene coexpression network analysis (WGCNA) and differential analysis. Subsequently, essential signature genes were identified using logistic least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) and support vector machine-recursive feature elimination (SVM-RFE) algorithms. Gene Ontology (GO), Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG), and single-sample gene set enrichment analysis (ssGSEA) were utilized to reveal the potential functions of the target genes. Furthermore, the Pearson correlation of signature genes with leptin and lipocalin was also explored. Finally, we constructed a robust endogenous RNA (ceRNA) network based on miRWalk and starBase databases. RESULTS: We identified 18 overlapping genes from 91 hub genes, and 165 differentially expressed mRNAs (DE-mRNA), which were revealed to be significantly associated with immune cells, immune response, inflammatory response, lipid storage, and localization upon functional enrichment analysis. Three signature genes, IRF1, NFKBIA, and YRDC, were identified from the 18 overlapping genes by LASSO and SVM-REF algorithms. The logistic regression model based on the three signature genes highlighted how robustly they discriminated between samples. ssGSEA indicated these genes to be involved in lipid metabolism and degradation pathways. Moreover, leptin levels were significantly reduced in patients undergoing LSG, and NFKBIA significantly negatively correlated with leptin. Finally, we identified how the long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) ATP2B1-AS1 regulated the expression of the signature genes by competitively binding to six microRNAs (miRNAs), which were hsa-miR-6509-5p, hsa-miR-330-5P, hsa-miR-154-5P, hsa-miR-145-5P, hsa-miR4726-5P and hsa-miR-134-5P. CONCLUSION: This study identified three critical regulatory genes significantly differentiated between patients before and after LSG treatment and highlighted their potentially crucial role after bariatric surgery. This provides novel insights to increase our understanding of the underlying mechanisms of weight loss and associated metabolic improvement after bariatric surgery.\", 'CI': ['Copyright (c) 2023 Liu, Chen, Ran, Yin, Zhang, Yang, Cen, Dai, Zhou, Gao, Zhang,', 'Liu, Chen and Wang.'], 'FAU': ['Liu, Na', 'Chen, Xiaolei', 'Ran, Jianghua', 'Yin, Jianhui', 'Zhang, Lijun', 'Yang, Yuelin', 'Cen, Jianchang', 'Dai, Hongmei', 'Zhou, Jiali', 'Gao, Kui', 'Zhang, Jihong', 'Liu, Liyin', 'Chen, Zhiyuan', 'Wang, Haibin'], 'AU': ['Liu N', 'Chen X', 'Ran J', 'Yin J', 'Zhang L', 'Yang Y', 'Cen J', 'Dai H', 'Zhou J', 'Gao K', 'Zhang J', 'Liu L', 'Chen Z', 'Wang H'], 'AD': [\"Department of Endocrinology, The First People's Hospital of Kunming, Kunming, Yunnan, China.\", \"Department of Endocrinology, The First People's Hospital of Kunming, Kunming, Yunnan, China.\", \"Department of Endocrinology, The First People's Hospital of Kunming, Kunming, Yunnan, China.\", \"Department of General Surgery, The First People's Hospital of Kunming, Kunming, Yunnan, China.\", \"Department of General Surgery, The First People's Hospital of Kunming, Kunming, Yunnan, China.\", \"Clinical Laboratory, The First People's Hospital of Kunming, Kunming, Yunnan, China.\", \"Department of Vascular Surgery, The First People's Hospital of Kunming, Kunming, Yunnan, China.\", \"Ophthalmology, The First People's Hospital of Kunming, Kunming, Yunnan, China.\", \"Department of Endocrinology, The First People's Hospital of Kunming, Kunming, Yunnan, China.\", \"Department of Endocrinology, The First People's Hospital of Kunming, Kunming, Yunnan, China.\", \"Department of General Surgery, The First People's Hospital of Kunming, Kunming, Yunnan, China.\", \"Department of General Surgery, The First People's Hospital of Kunming, Kunming, Yunnan, China.\", 'Faculty of Physical Education, Kunming University of Science and Technology, Kunming, Yunnan, China.', 'Department of Infectious Diseases, The Affiliated Hospital of YunNan University, Kunming, Yunnan, China.'], 'LA': ['eng'], 'PT': ['Journal Article'], 'DEP': '20230314', 'PL': 'Switzerland', 'TA': 'Front Endocrinol (Lausanne)', 'JT': 'Frontiers in endocrinology', 'JID': '101555782', 'RN': ['0 (Leptin)', '0 (MIRN6509 microRNA, human)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (YRDC protein, human)', '0 (RNA-Binding Proteins)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (GTP-Binding Proteins)', '0 (ATP2B1 protein, human)', 'EC 3.6.3.8 (Plasma Membrane Calcium-Transporting ATPases)', '0 (MIRN145 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (MIRN154 microRNA, human)', '0 (MIRN330 microRNA, human)'], 'SB': 'IM', 'MH': ['Humans', 'Leptin', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear', 'Transcriptome', 'East Asian People', '*Obesity, Morbid/genetics/surgery', '*Laparoscopy', 'RNA-Binding Proteins', 'GTP-Binding Proteins', 'Plasma Membrane Calcium-Transporting ATPases', '*MicroRNAs'], 'PMC': 'PMC10043499', 'OTO': ['NOTNLM'], 'OT': ['bioinformatics', 'high-throughput sequencing', 'laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG)', 'leptin', 'obesity'], 'COIS': ['The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any', 'commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential', 'conflict of interest.'], 'EDAT': '2023/04/01 06:00', 'MHDA': '2023/04/03 06:41', 'CRDT': ['2023/03/31 02:06'], 'PHST': ['2022/10/12 00:00 [received]', '2023/02/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2023/04/03 06:41 [medline]', '2023/03/31 02:06 [entrez]', '2023/04/01 06:00 [pubmed]'], 'AID': ['10.3389/fendo.2023.1049484 [doi]'], 'PST': 'epublish', 'SO': 'Front Endocrinol (Lausanne). 2023 Mar 14;14:1049484. doi: 10.3389/fendo.2023.1049484. eCollection 2023.'}]\n"

Studies postulated that a distinct metabolic signature of DR exists and can be resolved from that of diabetes alone. Serum Semaphorin3A (Sema3A) levels have also been found to be correlated with the phenotypes of diabetic retinopathy. We aimed to analyze and identify serum metabolites and serum Sema3A levels that could be useful biomarkers of DR progression. This cross-sectional study included 45 type 2 diabetes (T2D) patients. Diabetic patients were divided into three groups based on the status of their complications: non-DR (NDR, n=15), non-proliferative DR (NPDR, n=15), and proliferative DR (PDR, n=15) groups. Serum metabolomic profiles of these patients were determined by using high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS), and serum Sema3A levels measured by ELISA. Metabolomics analysis revealed a set of metabolites that were altered in the serum of PDR patients as compared with NPDR and NDR groups. Among these metabolites total asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA) and Kynurenine were potential predictors of PDR patients. Significantly higher serum levels of Sema3A in PDR patients as compared with NPDR and NDR groups (p < 0.001), their serum levels were positively correlated with the central macular thickness (r= 0.952, p < 0.001) and negatively correlated with the superficial macular density (r=-0.952, p < 0.001). In conclusion, the metabolite signatures identified in this study and serum Sema3A levels could be proposed as biomarkers for DR development and progression in T2D patients. However, Sema3A was superior to metabolomics in the prediction of the severity of DR.'], ['BDNF signaling in correlation-dependent structural plasticity in the developing visual system.', 'PLoS biology', '2023 Apr 3', '37011100', 'During development, patterned neural activity instructs topographic map refinement. Axons with similar patterns of neural activity converge onto target neurons and stabilize their synapses with these postsynaptic partners, restricting exploratory branch elaboration (Hebbian structural plasticity). On the other hand, non-correlated firing in inputs leads to synapse weakening and increased exploratory growth of axons (Stentian structural plasticity). We used visual stimulation to control the correlation structure of neural activity in a few ipsilaterally projecting (ipsi) retinal ganglion cell (RGC) axons with respect to the majority contralateral eye inputs in the optic tectum of albino Xenopus laevis tadpoles. Multiphoton live imaging of ipsi axons, combined with specific targeted disruptions of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) signaling, revealed that both presynaptic p75NTR and TrkB are required for Stentian axonal branch addition, whereas presumptive postsynaptic BDNF signaling is necessary for Hebbian axon stabilization. Additionally, we found that BDNF signaling mediates local suppression of branch elimination in response to correlated firing of inputs. Daily in vivo imaging of contralateral RGC axons demonstrated that p75NTR knockdown reduces axon branch elongation and arbor spanning field volume.'], ['Aqueous-deficient dry eye disease: Preferred practice pattern guidelines on clinical approach, diagnosis, and management.', 'Indian journal of ophthalmology', '2023 Apr', '37026265', 'Dry eye disease (DED) is a broad term that includes a diverse group of clinical disorders. Aqueous-deficient dry eye (ADDE), a subtype of DED, is characterized by decreased tear production by the lacrimal gland. It can be seen in up to one-third of individuals with DED and can be comorbid with a systemic autoimmune process or occur secondary to an environmental insult. Since ADDE can be a source of long-term suffering and severe visual impairment, early identification and adequate treatment are imperative. Multiple etiologies can underlie ADDE, and it is critical to identify the underlying cause to not only improve the ocular health but also to improve the overall quality of life and well-being of affected individuals. This review discusses the various etiologies of ADDE, highlights a pathophysiology-based approach for evaluating underlying contributors, outlines various diagnostic tests, and reviews treatment options. We present the current standards and discuss ongoing research in this field.

METHODS: The 2021 EAN/PNS clinical criteria for CIDP were applied to 329 patients fulfilling the electrodiagnostic (and in some cases also the supportive) criteria for the diagnosis of CIDP. Clinical characteristics were reviewed for each patient not strictly fulfilling the clinical criteria ('unclassifiable'). RESULTS: At study inclusion, 124 (37.5%) patients had an unclassifiable clinical presentation, including 110 (89%) with a typical CIDP-like clinical phenotype in whom some segments of the four limbs were unaffected by weakness ('incomplete typical CIDP'), 10 (8%) with a mild distal, symmetric, sensory or sensorimotor polyneuropathy confined to the lower limbs with cranial nerve involvement ('cranial nerve predominant CIDP') and 4 (1%) with a symmetric sensorimotor polyneuropathy limited to the proximal and distal areas of the lower limbs ('paraparetic CIDP'). Eighty-one (65%) patients maintained an unclassifiable presentation during the entire disease follow-up while 13 patients progressed to typical CIDP. Patients with the unclassifiable clinical forms compared with patients with typical CIDP had a milder form of CIDP, while there was no difference in the distribution patterns of demyelination. CONCLUSIONS: A proportion of patients with CIDP do not strictly fulfil the 2021 EAN/PNS clinical criteria for diagnosis. These unclassifiable clinical phenotypes may pose diagnostic challenges and thus deserve more attention in clinical practice and research.\"], ['Role of in vivo confocal microscopy in dry eye disease and eye pain.', 'Indian journal of ophthalmology', '2023 Apr', '37026240', 'Dry eye disease is known to have a lot of variability in presentation with overlapping subtypes.

Potential targets of active components were retrieved from SwissTargetPrediction. RVO-related targets were acquired from related disease databases. Core targets of SQWMG against RVO were acquired by overlapping the above targets. The 66 components (including 5 isomers) and 169 targets were obtained and concluded into a component-target network. Together with biological enrichment analysis of targets, it revealed the crucial role of the \"PI3K-Akt signaling pathway\", \"MAPK signaling pathway\" and their downstream factor iNOS and TNF-alpha. The 20 key targets of SQWMG in treating RVO were acquired from the network and pathway analysis. The effects of SQWMG on targets and pathways were validated by molecular docking based on AutoDock Vina and qPCR experiment. The molecular docking showed great affinity for these components and targets, especially on ganoderic acids (GA) and alisols (AS), which were both triterpenoids and qPCR exhibited remarkably reduced inflammatory factor gene expression through regulation of these two pathways.

Stromal cells can adopt new phenotypes to promote tumor cell invasion. A deep understanding of the signaling pathways involved in cell-to-cell and cell-to-ECM interactions is needed to design effective intervention strategies that might interrupt these interactions. In this review, we describe the tumor microenvironment (TME) components and associated therapeutics. We discuss the clinical advances in the prevalent and newly discovered signaling pathways in the TME, the immune checkpoints and immunosuppressive chemokines, and currently used inhibitors targeting these pathways. These include both intrinsic and non-autonomous tumor cell signaling pathways in the TME: protein kinase C (PKC) signaling, Notch, and transforming growth factor (TGF-beta) signaling, Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER) stress response, lactate signaling, Metabolic reprogramming, cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS)-stimulator of interferon genes (STING) and Siglec signaling pathways.

In addition, this review provides a holistic understanding of the TME as we discuss the three-dimensional and microfluidic models of the TME, which are believed to recapitulate the original characteristics of the patient tumor and hence may be used as a platform to study new mechanisms and screen for various anti-cancer therapies. We further discuss the systemic influences of gut microbiota in TME reprogramming and treatment response. Overall, this review provides a comprehensive analysis of the diverse and most critical signaling pathways in the TME, highlighting the associated newest and critical preclinical and clinical studies along with their underlying biology.

METHODS: A prospective survey was conducted at the ED of Zhongshan Ophthalmic Center from January 1, 2021, to May 31, 2021. Clinical data from patients with acute ophthalmic conditions lasting less than 7 days were collected via a standard questionnaire and the urgency levels assigned by nurses and physicians were also recorded. Binary logistic regression was performed to identify characteristics associated with truly emergency conditions and up- or down-triage. RESULTS: A total of 1907 patients were enrolled, with 582 (30.5%) classified as \"non-emergency.\" Red eye (69.7%), eye pain (53.0%), ocular trauma (44.1%), tearing (43.6%), and blurred vision (43.1%) were the most common complaints. Truly emergency tended to be male (OR 2.019, p < 0.001) and with unilateral eye involvement (OR 2.992, p < 0.001). Nurses prioritized conjunctival, scleral, closed ocular trauma and eyelid diseases over doctors while giving less priority to open ocular trauma, cornea, uveitis, and vitreoretinal diseases (p < 0.05). Overemphasis on mild blurred vision (OR 3.718, p = 0.001) and insufficient understanding of conjunctival diseases without red eye (OR 0.254, p = 0.001) were associated with conjunctival disease \"up-triage.\" Insufficient awareness of moderate and severe blurred vision was associated with \"down-triage\" for ocular trauma (OR 3.475, p = 0.001 and OR 2.422, p = 0.020, respectively). CONCLUSION: Ophthalmic EDs are typically flooded with patients suffering from acute ocular problems, with a considerable portion for non-emergency conditions.

METHODS: Articles and reviews related to teaching reforms in physiology published between January 1, 2012, and December 31, 2021, were obtained from the Web of Science Core Collection. Two Scientometric software applications (CiteSpace 5.7 and VOSviewer 1.6.15) were used to perform bibliometric and knowledge-map analysis, generate network maps, and identify research trends and top keywords, authors, co-cited authors, institutions, countries, journals, and references. RESULTS: The search identified a total of 2,882 papers in 466 academic journals by 13,895 authors from 4,072 organizations in 67 countries/regions. Physiology teaching reform-related publications increased rapidly over time. Arango-Lasprilla and Rivera published the most papers, while Moseley had the most co-citations. Active collaborations among physiology researchers were noted. Advances in Physiology Education published the most papers on physiology teaching reforms and was also the top co-cited journal in the Medicine/Medical/Clinical, Psychology/Education/Health, and Neurology/Sports/Ophthalmology fields. The United States and University of California published the most physiology teaching publications in the search criteria. Ten references (research articles and reviews) on mechanisms and diseases were identified as the knowledge base. The mainstream research directions were education, Alzheimer's disease, performance, physiology, and risk factors. Mental health and emotion regulation are increasing in significance and may become new hotspots. The research trend to move from the field of pain pathogenesis to the field of neuropsychiatry has become increasingly clear. This tendency away from peripheral system-based disorders to central system-based orders is inextricably linked to further developments in physiological understanding of the brain. CONCLUSION: This study analyzed the research hot spots and frontiers of teaching reforms on in physiology using bibliometric and visual methods. Based on the results, rehabilitation, neurosciences, and infectious disease are hot topics in physiology. In particular, the pathogenesis of neurological diseases, treatment strategies, and technology updates have gradually become research hotspots. We predict that this trend is closely related to the implementation of brain research programs in various countries.

Methods: This post hoc analysis of the VISTA and VIVID randomized controlled clinical trials, in which 862 eyes with central-involved DME were randomly assigned to IAI 2 mg every 4 weeks (2q4; 290 eyes), IAI 2 mg every 8 weeks after 5 initial monthly doses (2q8; 286 eyes), or macular laser (286 eyes) and followed through 100 weeks. Correlations between the change in CST and change in BCVA from baseline to weeks 12, 52, and 100 were assessed using the Pearson correlation. Results: The respective correlations (r [95% CI]) at weeks 12, 52, and 100 were -0.39 (-0.49 to -0.29), -0.27 (-0.38 to -0.15), and -0.30 (-0.41 to -0.17) in the 2q4 arm and -0.28 (-0.39 to -0.17), -0.29 (-0.41 to -0.17), and -0.33 (-0.44 to -0.20) in the 2q8 arm. Linear regression analysis of the correlation at week 100, adjusted for relevant baseline factors, showed CST changes accounted for 17% of the variance in BCVA changes; every 100-microm decrease in CST was associated with a 1.2-letter increase in BCVA (P = .001). Conclusions: Correlations between the change in CST and change in BCVA after 2q4 or 2q8 fixed-dosing IAI for DME were modest. Although a change in CST might be important in determining the need for antivascular endothelial growth factor for DME at follow-up, it was not a good surrogate for VA outcomes.'], ['Rasch development and validation of the \"Medellin Dry Eye Inventory\" (ME.Dry), an instrument to measure multidimensional quality of life compromise in patients with dry eye disease.', 'Indian journal of ophthalmology', '2023 Apr', '37026277', 'PURPOSE: Dry eye disease (DED) is a common condition that affects the quality of life.

A series of focus groups were performed to determine the best items to be included. A Rasch modeling methodology was used to validate the Medellin Dry Eye Inventory (ME.Dry). After iterative analysis and scale modification, a final version of the scale was attained which complied with the Rasch analysis expectations. Correlation between the different subscales of the ME.Dry and the Ocular Surface Disease Index (OSDI) was evaluated through Spearman correlation. RESULTS: A total of 166 patients with DED were included. Rasch modeling demonstrated an excellent behavior for the ME.Dry, including four subscales: Symptoms, Triggers, Activity Limitation, and Emotional Compromise. Infit and Outfit parameters were all between 0.50 and 1.50, with excellent category utilization. Person and item separation and reliability were excellent for all subscales. There was a need for a category collapsing for the Emotional Compromise subscale. There was a strong correlation between the different subscales of the ME.Dry except for the Emotional Compromise subscale, which seems to be independent. CONCLUSION: The ME.Dry is a reliable scale, complying with the Rasch model expectations, that allows for a reliable measurement of quality of life compromise in patients with DED. Emotional compromise secondary to DED does not seem to correlate with disease severity as assessed by the other quality-of-life subscales.'], [\"Widespread genomic influences on phenotype in Dravet syndrome, a 'monogenic' condition.\", 'Brain : a journal of neurology', '2023 Apr 3', '37006128', 'Dravet syndrome is an archetypal rare severe epilepsy, considered \"monogenic\", typically caused by loss-of-function SCN1A variants.

The academic performance was recorded and provided by the participating schools and further standardized. Other information was collected using an online standardized questionnaire. Mixed-effects model and B-Spline method were used to investigate the association between time spent on different types of daily activity, including outdoor activity and academic performance. RESULTS: A total of 3291 children with mean age 9.25 years were included in the final analysis. Overall, outdoor time was associated with academic performance in a non-linear manner; specifically, not exceeding 2.3 h per day, outdoor time was positively associated with academic performance; exceeding 2.3 h per day, this association became non-significant. Likewise, daily sleep duration and out-of-school learning time were associated with academic performance in a non-linear manner, resulting in turning points of 11.3 and 1.4 h per day, respectively. Separate analysis showed that outdoor time and sleep duration but not out-of-school learning time were positively associated with academic performance in Chinese, mathematics and English.

Activation of A(2A)R in the LS augmented the spiking frequency of A(2A)R-positive neurons leading to a decreased activation of surrounding neurons and the bi-directional manipulation of LS-A(2A)R activity demonstrated that LS-A(2A)Rs are necessary and sufficient to trigger depressive phenotypes. Thus, the optogenetic modulation (stimulation or inhibition) of LS-A(2A)R-positive neuronal activity or LS-A(2A)R-positive neurons projection terminals to the LHb or DMH, phenocopied depressive behaviors.

The group consisted of 11 males and 5 females. The inclusion criteria for the study were the presence of typical clinical manifestations of Nocardia keratitis and at least one positive pathogenic test (corneal scraping or microbial culture) indicating Nocardia infection. The medical history, clinical and microbiological examination data of the patients were analyzed, including risk factors, diagnosis time, clinical manifestations, diagnostic methods, strain isolation, cure time, and best corrected visual acuity before and after treatment. This study utilized techniques such as slit lamp microscopy, in vivo confocal microscopy (IVCM), scraping cytology, microbial culture, and mass spectrometry identification. Results: The main risk factors for Nocardia keratitis included plant or foreign body injuries (5 out of 16 cases), contact lens use (4 out of 16 cases), and surgery (2 out of 16 cases). The average time to diagnosis was (20.8+/-11.8) days, with the shortest time being 8 days and the longest being 60 days. The best corrected visual acuity was less than 0.05 in 7 patients, between 0.05 to 0.3 in 7 patients, and greater than or equal to 0.3 in 2 patients. The typical symptoms included superficial gray-white infiltration in a wreath-like pattern on the cornea, corneal ulcers with dry and gray-white necrotic tissue coverage, and in severe cases, corneal ulcer perforation. Nocardia corneal infection was identified in 12 out of 16 cases by scraping cytology, 9 out of 16 cases by mass spectrometry, and 8 out of 16 cases by both methods. IVCM showed the presence of fine and moderately reflective filamentous hyphae in the subepithelial and superficial stromal layer of the cornea, arranged in elongated, beaded, and branched structures. Infiltration of many hyper-reflective round inflammatory cells was also seen around the hyphae. Fourteen cases were treated with medication and 2 cases were treated with corneal transplantation.

Compared with the preoperative data, the anterior central corneal elevation significantly decreased (P<0.001), the mean keratometry significantly decreased (P<0.05), and the central corneal thickness significantly increased (P<0.001). The corneal biomechanical strength was significantly improved, with the deformation amplitude ratio at 2.0 mm decreasing from 1.39+/-0.14 preoperatively to 1.21+/-0.10 at 24 months postoperatively (P<0.001) and the stiffness parameter at the first applanation increasing from 41.49+/-11.47 preoperatively to 88.41+/-18.17 at 24 months postoperatively (P<0.001). There were no significant changes in the mean best-corrected visual acuity, posterior corneal elevation, mean spherical equivalent, and endothelial cell density (all P>0.05).

METHODS: Individual finite element models of myopic eyes were constructed based on the clinical data. Then, four types of corneal cap thicknesses after SMILE were included for each model. The biomechanical effects of material parameters and intraocular pressure on corneas with different cap thicknesses were analyzed. RESULTS: When the cap thickness increased, the vertex displacements of the anterior and posterior corneal surfaces decreased slightly. The corneal stress distributions demonstrated little change. Regarding wave-front aberrations caused by the displacements of the anterior surface, the absolute defocus value decreased slightly, but the magnitude of primary spherical aberration increased slightly. The horizontal coma increased, and the levels of other low-order and high-order aberrations were small and demonstrated little change. The corneal vertex displacement and wave-front aberration were significantly affected by elastic modulus and intraocular pressure, whereas the corneal stress distribution was greatly affected by intraocular pressure. There were obvious individual differences in the biomechanical responses of human eyes. CONCLUSIONS: The biomechanical difference of different corneal cap thicknesses after SMILE was small. The effect of corneal cap thickness was significantly less than that resulting from material parameters and intraocular pressure. TRANSLATIONAL RELEVANCE: Individual models were constructed based on the clinical data. The elastic modulus was controlled by programming to simulate its heterogeneous distribution in the actual human eye. The simulation was improved to bridge the gap between basic research and clinical care.'], ['Integrative Single-Cell Transcriptomics and Epigenomics Mapping of the Fetal Retina Developmental Dynamics.', 'Advanced science (Weinheim, Baden-Wurttemberg, Germany)', '2023 Apr 5', '37017569', 'The underlying mechanisms that determine gene expression and chromatin accessibility in retinogenesis are poorly understood. Herein, single-cell RNA sequencing and single-cell assay for transposase-accessible chromatin sequencing are performed on human embryonic eye samples obtained 9-26 weeks after conception to explore the heterogeneity of retinal progenitor cells (RPCs) and neurogenic RPCs. The differentiation trajectory from RPCs to 7 major types of retinal cells are verified. Subsequently, diverse lineage-determining transcription factors are identified and their gene regulatory networks are refined at the transcriptomic and epigenomic levels. Treatment of retinospheres, with the inhibitor of RE1 silencing transcription factor, X5050, induces more neurogenesis with the regular arrangement, and a decrease in Muller glial cells. The signatures of major retinal cells and their correlation with pathogenic genes associated with multiple ocular diseases, including uveitis and age-related macular degeneration are also described.

People are becoming increasingly aware of the impact of microbial disorders on host immunity and allergic diseases. Studies have demonstrated an association between allergic diseases and the microbiome, but much remains unknown. We assessed changes in the conjunctival microbiome and nasal microbiome in patients with ARC or AR. METHODS: Conjunctival swabs and nasal swabs were collected from each participant for 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing. Bacterial communities were analyzed. RESULTS: Forty patients with ARC, 20 patients suffering from AR, and 34 healthy controls (HCs) were recruited. This study found the abundance of conjunctival microbiome in patients with ARC or AR was significantly lower than that in HCs. The diversity of conjunctival microbiome in patients with AR was significantly lower than those in the other two groups. There is no significant difference in abundance of nasal microbiome between the three groups. The diversities of nasal microbiome in patients with ARC or AR were significantly lower than that in HCs. We found significant differences in microbiota compositions in patients with ARC or AR compared with those in HCs. However, no significant difference in microbiota compositions was found between patients with ARC and patients with AR. Microbiome functions in the ARC group and AR group were also altered compared with HCs. CONCLUSIONS: We revealed changes in the composition and function of the conjunctival microbiome and nasal microbiome of patients with ARC or AR, which suggests that there is a relationship between allergic conditions and the local microbiome.'], ['Diabetic retinopathy progression in patients under monitoring for treatment or vision loss: external validation and update of a multivariable prediction model.', 'BMJ open', '2023 Apr 3', '37012014', 'INTRODUCTION: The number of people with diabetes mellitus is increasing globally and consequently so too is diabetic retinopathy (DR). Most patients with diabetes are monitored through the diabetic eye screening programme (DESP) until they have signs of retinopathy and these changes progress, requiring referral into hospital eye services (HES). Here, they continue to be monitored until they require treatment. Due to current pressures on HES, delays can occur, leading to harm. There is a need to triage patients based on their individual risk. At present, patients are stratified according to retinopathy stage alone, yet other risk factors like glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) may be useful. Therefore, a prediction model that combines multiple prognostic factors to predict progression will be useful for triage in this setting to improve care.We previously developed a Diabetic Retinopathy Progression model to Treatment or Vision Loss (DRPTVL-UK) using a large primary care database. The aim of the present study is to externally validate the DRPTVL-UK model in a secondary care setting, specifically in a population under care by HES. This study will also provide an opportunity to update the model by considering additional predictors not previously available. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: We will use a retrospective cohort of 2400 patients with diabetes aged 12 years and over, referred from DESP to the NHS hospital trusts with referable DR between 2013 and 2016, with follow-up information recorded until December 2021.We will evaluate the external validity of the DRPTVL-UK model using measures of discrimination, calibration and net benefit. In addition, consensus meetings will be held to agree on acceptable risk thresholds for triage within the HES system.

Our aim in this study is to evaluate whether a foresight about the prognosis of patients with CSCR can be obtained by optical coherence tomography (OCT) findings. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients diagnosed with chronic CSCR at Fatih Sultan Mehmet Research and Training Hospital, Ophthalmology Department, were screened between January 2017 and September 2019, and 30 patients were included in the study. The anatomical and functional changes of the patients during the 6-month follow-up and the relationship between the OCT findings at baseline and the best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) in the sixth month were evaluated. RESULTS: All of the participants were treated with subthreshold micropulse laser therapy. BCVA increased significantly at first month and sixth month examinations compared to baseline, while the central macular thicknesses decreased significantly (p=0.01, p=0.00). Among the parameters examined in the baseline OCT, a positive correlation was found between the thickness of the outer nuclear layer (r=-0.520, p=0.003) and BCVA at sixth month. In addition, subretinal fluid density and the number of intra-subretinal hyperreflective dots negatively affected BCVA (r=0.371, p=0.044 and r=0.509, p=0.004). CONCLUSION: Outer nuclear layer thickness, subretinal fluid density and intra-subretinal hyperreflective dots were the OCT biomarkers related to sixth month BCVA.

However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the improvement of metabolic health following this process warrants more investigation. This study investigates LSG-related molecules and uses bulk RNA-sequencing high-throughput analysis to unravel their regulatory mechanisms. METHODS: Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were collected from ten obese patients with BMI >/= 32.5 kg/m(2) in the Department of General Surgery of Kunming First People's Hospital. After LSG, patients were followed up for one month, and blood samples were retaken. Blood samples from ten patients before and after LSG and bulk RNA-Seq data were analyzed in this study. LSG-associated gene expression was detected by weighted gene coexpression network analysis (WGCNA) and differential analysis. Subsequently, essential signature genes were identified using logistic least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) and support vector machine-recursive feature elimination (SVM-RFE) algorithms. Gene Ontology (GO), Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG), and single-sample gene set enrichment analysis (ssGSEA) were utilized to reveal the potential functions of the target genes. Furthermore, the Pearson correlation of signature genes with leptin and lipocalin was also explored. Finally, we constructed a robust endogenous RNA (ceRNA) network based on miRWalk and starBase databases. RESULTS: We identified 18 overlapping genes from 91 hub genes, and 165 differentially expressed mRNAs (DE-mRNA), which were revealed to be significantly associated with immune cells, immune response, inflammatory response, lipid storage, and localization upon functional enrichment analysis. Three signature genes, IRF1, NFKBIA, and YRDC, were identified from the 18 overlapping genes by LASSO and SVM-REF algorithms. The logistic regression model based on the three signature genes highlighted how robustly they discriminated between samples. ssGSEA indicated these genes to be involved in lipid metabolism and degradation pathways. Moreover, leptin levels were significantly reduced in patients undergoing LSG, and NFKBIA significantly negatively correlated with leptin. Finally, we identified how the long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) ATP2B1-AS1 regulated the expression of the signature genes by competitively binding to six microRNAs (miRNAs), which were hsa-miR-6509-5p, hsa-miR-330-5P, hsa-miR-154-5P, hsa-miR-145-5P, hsa-miR4726-5P and hsa-miR-134-5P. CONCLUSION: This study identified three critical regulatory genes significantly differentiated between patients before and after LSG treatment and highlighted their potentially crucial role after bariatric surgery.

METHODS: The study was carried out in two phases. In the first phase, a cross-cultural adaptation of CLDEQ-8 to Italian was performed by forward and backward translation in sequence. In the second phase, a multi-centre study was conducted for the validation of the questionnaire. Validity CLDEQ-8_IT was evaluated against three gestalt questions: overall opinion of soft contact lenses (CLs), global self-assessments of eye sensitivity and eye dryness. Reliability was evaluated by test-retest assessment in a subgroup of subjects. Finally, the psychometric properties of CLDEQ-8_IT were explored by Rasch analysis. RESULTS: Two hundred and forty soft CL wearers, fluent Italian speakers (73 males and 167 females), between 18 and 70 years of age were enrolled. A significant correlation was found between CLDEQ-8_IT and each of the three Gestalt questions. The cutoff score of 12 points demonstrated the best balance between sensitivity and specificity in differentiating wearers grading their CLs as \"Excellent/Very good\" from those reporting their overall opinion as \"Good/Fair/Poor\". The Intraclass Correlation Coefficient between test and retest was 0.88 (95% CI: 0.81-0.92). Finally, infit and outfit statistics using Rasch analysis for the 8 items were in a good range, however Principal Components Analysis revealed a certain degree of multi-dimensionality of the instrument. Also, item 8 analysis could be computed after merging the last two response categories. CONCLUSION: The CLDEQ-8_IT showed very good validity and reliability in measuring symptoms of CL wearers, comparable to the original English language version. A cut-off of 12 was confirmed as yielding the best balance between sensitivity and specificity in detecting CL wearers who could benefit from clinical management of their CL-related symptoms.

Methods: A theoretical model was constructed from the physician's perspective for performing a 90-minute uncomplicated RD surgery with its associated perioperative work in the global period (Current Procedural Terminology code 67108) compared with managing 40 patients per 8-hour clinic day in the equivalent time period. The reimbursement rates were based on the 2019 values set by the US Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS). Sensitivity analyses were performed varying the perioperative times, clinical productivity, and postoperative visits. Results: The CMS physician reimbursement rate for 67108 surgery was 17.13 work relative value units (wRVUs); meanwhile, the physician in the reference case could have generated 40.89 wRVUs in the office. CMS reimbursement therefore represented a 58% opportunity cost relative to lost office productivity for the physician. A significant disparity was still present even when modeling 30 patients per day. In sensitivity analyses, clinical productivity exceeded surgical compensation in 99% of modeled scenarios. In threshold analyses, the surgeon in the reference case would have to complete the surgery and all immediate perioperative care within 18 minutes to equal the total CMS valuation. Conclusions: CMS reimbursement for RD surgery resulted in a significant opportunity cost for the physician relative to office-based patient care, which was more pronounced for more efficient clinicians in the office. The sensitivity analyses supported the robustness of the model. Reductions in surgery reimbursements relative to office-based patient care might disincentivize busy clinicians.\"], ['Clinical efficacy of a new surgical technique of oral mucosal epithelial transplantation for severe ocular surface disorders.', 'BMC ophthalmology', '2023 Apr 7', '37029360', 'BACKGROUND: Severe ocular surface disorders are one of the major blinding diseases, and a paucity of original tissue obscures successful reconstruction. We developed a new surgical technique of direct oral mucosal epithelial transplantation (OMET) to reconstruct severely damaged ocular surfaces in 2011. This study elaborates on the clinical efficacy of OMET. METHODS: A retrospective review of patients with severe ocular surface disorders who underwent OMET from 2011 to 2021 at the Department of Ophthalmology, Sir Run Run Shaw Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine was conducted. Patients who were followed up for at least 3 months postoperatively and had sufficient pre or postoperative records were included. Surgical efficacy was evaluated by comparing the best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), corneal transparency, neovascularization grade, and symblepharon grade. Additionally, postoperative ocular surface impression cytology was used to study the morphology of the newborn epithelial cells. RESULTS: Forty-eight patients (49 eyes; mean age: 42.55 +/- 12.40 years, range:12-66 years) were enrolled in the study. The etiology included chemical burns (30 eyes), thermal burns (16 eyes), explosive injuries (1 eye), Stevens-Johnson syndrome (1 eye), and multiple pterygiums (1 eye). The mean follow-up period was 25.97 +/- 22.99 months. Postoperatively, 29 eyes (59.18%) showed improved corneal transparency, 26 eyes (53.06%) had improved BCVA, 47 eyes (95.92%) had a stable epithelium until the final follow-up, 44 eyes (89.80%) had a reduced neovascularization grade. Of the 20 eyes with preoperative symblepharon, 15 (75%) were completely resolved, and five (25%) were partially resolved.

This study describes tumor-derived analyte concentrations from aqueous humor (AH) liquid biopsy and its use in clinical assays. DESIGN: Case series study. PARTICIPANTS: Sixty-two RB eyes from 55 children and 14 control eyes from 12 children from 4 medical centers. METHODS: This study included 128 RB AH samples including: diagnostic (DX) samples, samples from eyes undergoing treatment (TX), samples after completing treatment (END), and during bevacizumab injection for radiation therapy after completing RB treatment (BEV). Fourteen-control AH were analyzed for unprocessed analytes (double-stranded DNA [dsDNA], single-stranded DNA [ssDNA], micro-RNA [miRNA], RNA, and protein) with Qubit fluorescence assays. Double-stranded DNA from 2 RB AH samples underwent low-pass whole-genome sequencing to detect somatic copy number alterations. Logistic regression was used to predict disease burden given analyte concentrations. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Unprocessed analyte (dsDNA, ssDNA, miRNA, RNA and protein) concentrations. RESULTS: Results revealed dsDNA, ssDNA, miRNA, and proteins, but not RNA, were quantifiable in most samples (up to 98%) with Qubit fluorescence assays. Median dsDNA concentration was significantly higher in DX (3.08 ng/mul) compared to TX (0.18 ng/mul; P < 0.0001) at an order of 17 times greater and 20 times greater than END samples (0.15 ng/mul; P = 0.001). Using logistic regression, nucleic acid concentrations were useful in predicting higher versus lower RB disease burden. Retinoblastoma somatic copy number alterations were identified in a TX, but not in a BEV sample, indicating the correlation with RB activity. CONCLUSIONS: Aqueous humor liquid biopsy in RB is a high-yield source of dsDNA, ssDNA, miRNA, and protein. Diagnostic samples are most useful for RB 1 gene mutational analyses.

Lately, accumulated evidence has demonstrated that exosomes serve an important role in prognosis, diagnosis, and even treatment strategies. While several reviews have collective information on the biomedical application of exosomes, a comprehensive review incorporating updated and improved methodologies for beneficial applications of such vesicles in cancer theranostics is indispensable. In the current review, we first provided a comprehensive review of the introduction of exosomes, featuring their discovery, separation, characterization, function, biogenesis, secretion. The implications of exosomes as promising nanovehicles for drug and gene delivery, application of exosome inhibitors in the management of cancers, completed and ongoing clinical trials on the biological relevance of exosomes are then discussed in detail.

The main outcome measures were visual acuity (VA) and intraoperative and postoperative complications. RESULTS: The analysis comprised 648 eyes of 611 patients. The median follow-up was 26.9 months (range, 12-60 months). The most common vitreoretinal pathology was intraocular tumor (53%). The best-corrected Snellen VA improved from 20/192 at baseline to 20/46 at the 12-month follow-up. The most frequent intraoperative complication was capsule tear (3.9%). The most common postoperative adverse events after 3 months of follow-up (mean, 24 months) were vitreous hemorrhage (3.2%) and retinal detachment (1.8%). No patient developed endophthalmitis.

Methods: A retrospective series of 2 cases is reported. Results: Two pediatric patients receiving treatment for Coats disease were included. In both cases, vision worsened secondary to paradoxically increased exudation and macular star formation following standard treatment with intravitreal bevacizumab, sub-Tenon triamcinolone acetonide, and laser photocoagulation. After serial treatments under general anesthesia, the exudates in both cases consolidated. Conclusions: A paradoxical exudative retinopathy can occur in some patients when initiating standard treatment of Coats disease.

In the present study, we applied a two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) method to investigate their causal relationship. METHODS: MR analysis was conducted to validate the causal associations between AS with glaucoma using summary statistics from the genome-wide association studies of AS (9,069 cases and 13,578 control subjects) and glaucoma (8,591 cases and 210,201 control subjects). The inverse variance weighting method was performed to evaluate the causal relationship. The MR-Egger regression approach was applied to assess pleiotropy, while Cochran's Q test was used to analyze heterogeneity. Subgroup analysis was performed according to primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) and primary angle-closure glaucoma (PACG). RESULTS: The results of the MR study reveal a risk-increasing causal relationship between AS and glaucoma among European populations (OR = 1.35, 95%CI = 1.16-1.57, P = 8.81 x 10(-5)).

This study aimed to investigate the metabolite profile of aqueous humor (AH) in patients with ME of different etiologies and identify potential metabolite biomarkers for early diagnosis of ME. METHODS: Samples of AH were collected from 60 patients with ME and 20 age- and sex-matched controls and analyzed by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC/MS)-based metabolomics. A series of univariate and multivariate statistical analyses were performed to identify differential metabolites and enriched metabolite pathways. RESULTS: The metabolic profile of AH differed significantly between ME patients and healthy controls, and differentially expressed metabolites were identified. Pathway analysis revealed that these differentially expressed metabolites are mainly involved in lipid metabolism and amino acid metabolism. Moreover, significant differences were identified in the metabolic composition of AH from patients with ME due to different retinal diseases including age-related macular degeneration (AMD-ME), diabetic retinopathy (DME) and branch retinal vein occlusion (BRVO-ME). In total, 39 and 79 etiology-specific altered metabolites were identified for AMD-ME and DME, respectively. Finally, an AH-derived machine learning-based diagnostic model was developed and successfully validated in the test cohort with an area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve of 0.79 for AMD-ME, 0.94 for DME and 0.77 for BRVO-ME. CONCLUSIONS: Our study illustrates the potential underlying metabolic basis of AH of different etiologies across ME populations. We also identify AH-derived metabolite biomarkers that may improve the differential diagnosis and treatment stratification of ME patients with different etiologies.'], ['Correlation Between Lens Density Measured by Swept-Source Optical Coherence Tomography and Phacodynamic Parameters of Centurion Phacoemulsification.', 'Current eye research', '2023 Apr 3', '37009774', 'PURPOSE: To evaluate the correlation between lens density measured by IOL-Master 700 based on swept-source optical coherence tomography (SS-OCT) technology and the phacodynamic parameters of Centurion phacoemulsification in cataract surgery. METHODS: This prospective study included 66 patients (83 eyes) with age-related cataracts. Using the Lens Opacities Classification System III (LOCS III), the lens nuclear color (NC), lens nuclear opalescence (NO), cortical (C), and posterior subcapsular (P) opacities were obtained. Six meridian orientations of IOL-Master 700 images were captured, and the lens and nuclear regions were analyzed using ImageJ to generate the average lens nucleus density (AND) and average lens density (ALD). Phacodynamic parameters were recorded. The correlation between lens density and the phacodynamic parameters was analyzed. According to the AND, patients were divided into four groups (soft, medium-hard, hard, and extremely hard nucleus), and the phacodynamic parameters were compared among groups. RESULTS: The correlation between the AND obtained by LOCS III grading and SS-OCT-based cataract quantification system score (NC and NO) was statistically significant (r(NC) = 0.795, r(NO)=0.794, both p = .000). AND correlated significantly with cumulative dissipated energy (CDE, r = 0.545, p = .000), total ultrasound time (TUST, r = 0.354, p = .001), and total torsional ultrasound time (TTUT, r = 0.314, p = .004).

Abnormal aggregation of alpha-Syn is considered to be the main component of the Lewy bodies that are the pathological hallmarks of Parkinson's disease. Although expression pattern of alpha-Syn has been described in the retinas, its precise cellular and subcellular locations are poorly understood. We investigated the precise expression of alpha-Syn using light microscopy (LM) and electron microscopy (EM) with antibodies against alpha-Syn in the mouse retina. We found that the majority of alpha-Syn immunoreactivity (IR) is located in GABAergic, glycinergic, and dopaminergic amacrine cells, and their processes often make a direct synapse to other labeled or unlabeled amacrine profiles, bipolar cell terminals, or ganglion cell dendrites. Further, our LM and immuno-EM results confirm the absence of alpha-Syn in excitatory photoreceptors, bipolar cell bodies, and their ribbon synapses, providing evidence, for the first time, that ribbon synapses do not express alpha-Syn. Additionally, alpha-Syn IR is located in the ganglion cells, some of which are intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells. These results reveal a previously unappreciated inhibitory synapse-specific expression pattern of alpha-Syn in the retina, suggesting that alpha-Syn may play a distinct role in the modulation and integration of inhibitory synaptic transmission in the retina.\"], ['Benefits of a laser chorioretinal anastomosis plus ranibizumab vs ranibizumab alone for central retinal vein occlusion: 4-year results.', 'American journal of ophthalmology', '2023 Apr 6', '37030494', 'PURPOSE: Evaluate what clinical gains can be achieved over conventional treatment with ranibizumab alone for central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO) when causal pathology is additionally successfully addressed with a laser-induced chorio-retinal anastomosis (L-CRA).

DESIGN: A cross-sectional analysis of baseline and prospectively collected cohort data. PARTICIPANTS: UK Biobank (UKBB) participants of genetically determined European ancestry (n = 438 711). Replication analyses were performed using clinical and genotyping data collected from European participants recruited to the Canadian Longitudinal Study of Aging (CLSA; n = 18 199), the Australian and New Zealand Registry of Advanced Glaucoma (ANZRAG; n = 1970), and the Blue Mountains Eye Study (BMES; n = 2440). METHODS: Apolipoprotein E alleles and genotypes were determined, and their distributions were compared on the basis of glaucoma status. Similar analyses were performed using positive control outcomes associated with the APOE E4 allele (death, dementia, age-related macular degeneration) and negative control outcomes not associated with the APOE E4 allele (cataract, diabetic eye disease). Outcome phenotypes were also correlated with Alzheimer's dementia (AD), a clinical outcome highly associated with the APOE E4 allele. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Results of APOE E4 genotype-phenotype comparisons were reported as odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Replication analyses investigated APOE E4 associations in 2 replication cohorts (CLSA and ANZRAG/BMES). RESULTS: The APOE E4 allele was inversely associated with glaucoma (OR, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.93-0.99; P = 0.016) and both negative controls (cataract: OR, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.96-0.99; P = 0.015; diabetic eye disease: OR, 0.92; 95% CI, 0.87-0.97; P = 0.003) in the UKBB cohort.

It is caused by the formation of abnormal new blood vessels, which prevent normal drainage of aqueous from the anterior segment of the eye. Anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) medications are specific inhibitors of the primary mediators of neovascularization. Studies have reported the effectiveness of anti-VEGF medications for the control of intraocular pressure (IOP) in NVG. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effectiveness of intraocular anti-VEGF medications, alone or with one or more types of conventional therapy, compared with no anti-VEGF medications for the treatment of NVG. SEARCH METHODS: We searched CENTRAL (which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Trials Register); MEDLINE; Embase; PubMed; and LILACS to 19 October 2021; metaRegister of Controlled Trials to 19 October 2021; and two additional trial registers to 19 October 2021. We did not use any date or language restrictions in the electronic search for trials. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of people treated with anti-VEGF medications for NVG. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently assessed the search results for trials, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias, and the certainty of the evidence. We resolved discrepancies through discussion. MAIN RESULTS: We included five RCTs (356 eyes of 353 participants). Each trial was conducted in a different country: two in China, and one each in Brazil, Egypt, and Japan. All five RCTs included both men and women; the mean age of participants was 55 years or older. Two RCTs compared intravitreal bevacizumab combined with Ahmed valve implantation and panretinal photocoagulation (PRP) with Ahmed valve implantation and PRP alone. One RCT randomized participants to receive an injection of either intravitreal aflibercept or placebo at the first visit, followed by non-randomized treatment according to clinical findings after one week. The remaining two RCTs randomized participants to PRP with and without ranibizumab, one of which had insufficient details for further analysis. We assessed the RCTs to have an unclear risk of bias for most domains due to insufficient information to permit judgment.   Four RCTs examined achieving control of IOP, three of which reported our time points of interest. Only one RCT reported our critical time point at one month; it found that the anti-VEGF group had a 1.3-fold higher chance of achieving control of IOP at one month (RR 1.32, 95% 1.10 to 1.59; 93 participants) than the non-anti-VEGF group (low certainty of evidence). For other time points, one RCT found a three-fold greater achievement in control of IOP in the anti-VEGF group when compared with the non-anti-VEGF group at one year (RR 3.00; 95% CI:1.35 to 6.68; 40 participants). However, another RCT found an inconclusive result at the time period ranging from 1.5 years to three years (RR 1.08; 95% CI: 0.67 to 1.75; 40 participants).  All five RCTs examined mean IOP, but at different time points. Very-low-certainty evidence showed that anti-VEGFs were effective in reducing mean IOP by 6.37 mmHg (95% CI: -10.09 to -2.65; 3 RCTs; 173 participants) at four to six weeks when compared with no anti-VEGFs.  Anti-VEGFs may reduce mean IOP at three months (MD -4.25; 95% CI -12.05 to 3.54; 2 studies; 75 participants), six months (MD -5.93; 95% CI -18.13 to 6.26; 2 studies; 75 participants), one year (MD -5.36; 95% CI -18.50 to 7.77; 2 studies; 75 participants), and more than one year (MD -7.05; 95% CI -16.61 to 2.51; 2 studies; 75 participants) when compared with no anti-VEGFs, but such effects remain uncertain. Two RCTs reported the proportion of participants who achieved an improvement in visual acuity with specified time points. Participants receiving anti-VEGFs had a 2.6 times (95% CI 1.60 to 4.08; 1 study; 93 participants) higher chance of improving visual acuity when compared with those not receiving anti-VEGFs at one month (very low certainty of evidence). Likewise, another RCT found a similar result at 18 months (RR 4.00, 95% CI 1.33 to 12.05; 1 study; 40 participants).  Two RCTs reported the outcome, complete regression of new iris vessels, at our time points of interest. Low-certainty evidence showed that anti-VEGFs had a nearly three times higher chance of complete regression of new iris vessels when compared with no anti-VEGFs (RR 2.63, 95% CI 1.65 to 4.18; 1 study; 93 participants). A similar finding was observed at more than one year in another RCT (RR 3.20, 95% CI 1.45 to 7.05; 1 study; 40 participants).  Regarding adverse events, there was no evidence that the risks of hypotony and tractional retinal detachment were different between the two groups (RR 0.67; 95% CI: 0.12 to 3.57 and RR 0.33; 95% CI: 0.01 to 7.72, respectively; 1 study; 40 participants). No RCTs reported incidents of endophthalmitis, vitreous hemorrhage, no light perception, and serious adverse events. Evidence for the adverse events of anti-VEGFs was low due to limitations in the study design due to insufficient information to permit judgments and imprecision of results due to the small sample size. No trial reported the proportion of participants with relief of pain and resolution of redness at any time point. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Anti-VEGFs as an adjunct to conventional treatment could help reduce IOP in NVG in the short term (four to six weeks), but there is no evidence that this is likely in the longer term. Currently available evidence regarding the short- and long-term effectiveness and safety of anti-VEGFs in achieving control of IOP, visual acuity, and complete regression of new iris vessels in NVG is insufficient. More research is needed to investigate the effect of these medications compared with, or in addition to, conventional surgical or medical treatment in achieving these outcomes in NVG.\"], ['Intraocular Methotrexate for the Treatment and Prevention of Proliferative Vitreoretinopathy: A Review.', 'Journal of vitreoretinal diseases', '2023 Mar-Apr', '37006665', 'PURPOSE: To review the current literature on the use of intravitreal methotrexate (IVT MTX) for the treatment and prevention of proliferative vitreoretinopathy (PVR).

METHODS AND FINDINGS: We performed a systematic literature search in PubMed, Embase, VHL, Cochrane Library, Scopus, and DANS EASY Archive. All studies reporting patients with clinically and serologically confirmed OT presenting any clinical or paraclinical factor influencing recurrences, visual impairment, and blindness were included. Studies presenting secondary data, case reports, and case series were excluded. An initial selection was made by title and abstract, and then the studies were reviewed by full text where the eligible studies were selected. Then, the risk of bias was assessed through validated tools. Data were extracted using a validated extraction format. Qualitative synthesis and quantitative analysis were done. This study was registered on PROSPERO (CRD42022327836). RESULTS: Seventy two studies met the inclusion criteria. Fifty-three were summarized in the qualitative synthesis in three sections: clinical and environmental factors, parasite and host factors, and treatment-related factors. Of the 72 articles, 39 were included in the meta-analysis, of which 14 were conducted in South America, 13 in Europe, four in Asia, three multinational, two in North America and Central America, respectively, and only one in Africa. A total of 4,200 patients with OT were analyzed, mean age ranged from 7.3 to 65.1 year of age, with similar distribution by sex. The frequency of recurrences in patients with OT was 49% (95% CI 40%-58%), being more frequent in the South American population than in Europeans. Additionally, visual impairment was presented in 35% (95% CI 25%-48%) and blindness in 20% (95% CI 13%-30%) of eyes, with a similar predominance in South Americans than in Europeans. On the other hand, having lesions near the macula or adjacent to the optic nerve had an OR of 4.83 (95% CI; 2.72-8.59) for blindness, similar to having more than one recurrence that had an OR of 3.18 (95% CI; 1.59-6.38). Finally, the prophylactic therapy with Trimethoprim/Sulfamethoxazole versus the placebo showed a protective factor of 83% during the first year and 87% in the second year after treatment. CONCLUSION: Our Systematic Review showed that clinical factors such as being older than 40 years, patients with de novo OT lesions or with less than one year after the first episode, macular area involvement, lesions greater than 1 disc diameter, congenital toxoplasmosis, and bilateral compromise had more risk of recurrences. Also, environmental and parasite factors such as precipitations, geographical region where the infection is acquired, and more virulent strains confer greater risk of recurrences. Therefore, patients with the above mentioned clinical, environmental, and parasite factors could benefit from using prophylactic therapy.'], ['The impact of the image conversion factor and image centration on retinal vessel geometric characteristics.', 'Frontiers in medicine', '2023', '37007779', 'BACKGROUND: This study aims to use fundus image material from a long-term retinopathy follow-up study to identify problems created by changing imaging modalities or imaging settings (e.g., image centering, resolution, viewing angle, illumination wavelength). Investigating the relationship of image conversion factor and imaging centering on retinal vessel geometric characteristics (RVGC), offers solutions for longitudinal retinal vessel analysis for data obtained in clinical routine. METHODS: Retinal vessel geometric characteristics were analyzed in scanned fundus photographs with Singapore-I-Vessel-Assessment using a constant image conversion factor (ICF) and an individual ICF, applying them to macula centered (MC) and optic disk centered (ODC) images. The ICF is used to convert pixel measurements into mum for vessel diameter measurements and to establish the size of the measuring zone. Calculating a constant ICF, the width of all analyzed optic disks is included, and it is used for all images of a cohort. An individual ICF, in turn, uses the optic disk diameter of the eye analyzed. To investigate agreement, Bland-Altman mean difference was calculated between ODC images analyzed with individual and constant ICF and between MC and ODC images. RESULTS: With constant ICF (n = 104 eyes of 52 patients) the mean central retinal equivalent was 160.9 +/- 17.08 mum for arteries (CRAE) and 208.7 +/- 14.7.4 mum for veins (CRVE). The individual ICFs resulted in a mean CRAE of 163.3 +/- 15.6 mum and a mean CRVE of 219.0 +/- 22.3 mum. On Bland-Altman analysis, the individual ICF RVGC are more positive, resulting in a positive mean difference for most investigated parameters. Arteriovenous ratio (p = 0.86), simple tortuosity (p = 0.08), and fractal dimension (p = 0.80) agreed well between MC and ODC images, while the vessel diameters were significantly smaller in MC images (p < 0.002). CONCLUSION: Scanned images can be analyzed using vessel assessment software. Investigations of individual ICF versus constant ICF point out the asset of utilizing an individual ICF.

Data from 267 EEM patients were retrospectively analyzed by the EEM study group, and a dedicated multivariable logistic regression analysis was developed separately for each sex. We found that females with EEM showed a significantly higher rate of persistence of photosensitivity and eye closure sensitivity at the last visit, along with a higher prevalence of migraine with aura, whereas males with EEM presented a higher rate of borderline intellectual functioning/intellectual disability. In female patients, multivariable logistic regression analysis revealed age at epilepsy onset, eyelid myoclonia status epilepticus, psychiatric comorbidities and catamenial seizures as significant predictors of drug resistance. In male patients, a history of febrile seizures was the only predictor of drug resistance. Hence, our study reveals sex-specific differences both in terms of electroclinical features and prognostic factors.

The PubMed database was used to conduct the literature search, which used the keywords \"intense pulsed light\" and \"dry eye disease\". After the authors evaluated the articles for relevancy, 49 articles were reviewed. In general, all treatment modalities were proven to be clinically effective in reducing dry eye (DE) signs and symptoms; however, the level of improvement and persistence of outcomes differed amongst them. Meta-analysis indicated significant improvement in the Ocular Surface Disease Index (OSDI) scores post-treatment with a standardized mean difference (SMD) = -1.63; confidence interval (CI): -2.42 to -0.84. Moreover, a meta-analysis indicated a significant improvement in tear break-up time (TBUT) test values with SMD = 1.77; CI: 0.49 to 3.05. Research suggests that additive therapies, such as meibomian gland expression (MGX), sodium hyaluronate eye drops, heated eye mask, warm compress, lid hygiene, lid margin scrub, eyelid massage, antibiotic drops, cyclosporine drops, omega-3 supplements, steroid drops, and warm compresses along with IPL, have been found to work in tandem for greater effectiveness; however, in clinical practice, its feasibility and cost-effectiveness have to be taken into consideration. Current findings suggest that IPL therapy is suitable when lifestyle modifications such as reducing or eliminating the use of contact lenses, lubricating eye drops/gels, and warm compresses/eye masks fail to improve signs and symptoms of DE. Moreover, patients with compliance issues have been shown to benefit well as the effects of IPL therapy is sustained for over several months. DED is a multifactorial disorder, and IPL therapy has been found to be safe and efficient in reducing its signs and symptoms of meibomian gland dysfunction (MGD)-related DE. Although the treatment protocol varies among authors, current findings suggest that IPL has a positive effect on the signs and symptoms of MGD-related DE. However, patients in the early stages can benefit more from IPL therapy. Moreover, IPL has a better maintenance impact when used in conjunction with other traditional therapies.

DESIGN: A national 5-year register-based cohort study including 201 945 patients with diabetes. SUBJECTS: Patients with diabetes who had attended the Danish national screening program (2013-2018) for diabetic retinopathy (DR). METHODS: We used the first screening episode as the index date and included both eyes of patients with and without subsequent progression of PDR. Data were linked with various national health registries to investigate relevant clinical and demographic parameters. The International Clinical Retinopathy Disease Scale was used to classify DR, with no DR as level 0, mild DR as level 1, moderate DR as level 2, severe DR as level 3, and PDR as level 4. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Hazard ratios (HRs) for incident PDR for all relevant demographic and clinical parameters and 1-, 3-, and 5-year incidence rates of PDR according to baseline DR level. RESULTS: Progression to PDR within 5 years was identified in 2384 eyes of 1780 patients. Proliferative diabetic retinopathy progression rates from baseline DR level 3 at 1, 3 and 5 years were 3.6%, 10.9%, and 14.7%, respectively. The median number of visits was 3 (interquartile range, 1-4). Progression to PDR was predicted in a multivariable model by duration of diabetes (HR, 4.66 per 10 years; 95% confidence interval [CI], 4.05-5.37), type 1 diabetes (HR, 9.61; 95% CI, 8.01-11.53), a Charlson Comorbidity Index score of > 0 (score 1: HR, 4.62; 95% CI, 4.14-5.15; score 2: HR, 2.28; 95% CI, 1.90-2.74; score >/= 3: HR, 4.28; 95% CI, 3.54-5.17), use of insulin (HR, 5.33; 95% CI, 4.49-6.33), and use of antihypertensive medications (HR, 2.23; 95% CI, 1.90-2.61). CONCLUSIONS: In a 5-year longitudinal study of an entire screening nation, we found increased risk of PDR with increasing baseline DR levels, longer duration of diabetes, type 1 diabetes, systemic comorbidity, use of insulin, and blood pressure-lowering medications.

DESIGN: An extended follow-up of Zhongshan Angle Closure Prevention (ZAP) study. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 889 Chinese patients aged 50 to 70 years with bilateral PACS. METHODS: Each patient received LPI in one randomly selected eye, with the fellow untreated eye serving as a control. Since the risk of glaucoma was low and acute angle closure (AAC) only occurred in rare cases, the follow-up was extended to 14 years despite substantial benefits of LPI reported after the 6-year visit. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome was incidence of PAC, a composite endpoint including peripheral anterior synechiae (PAS), intraocular pressure (IOP) > 24 mmHg, or AAC. RESULTS: During the 14 years, 390 LPI-treated eyes and 388 control eyes were lost to the follow-up. A total of 33 LPI-treated eyes and 105 control eyes reached primary endpoints (P <0.01). Within them, twelve eyes developed AAC or primary angle closure glaucoma (AAC: five control eyes and one LPI-treated eye; PACG: four control eyes and two LPI-treated eyes). The hazard ratio for progression to PAC was 0.31 (95% confidence interval, 0.21-0.46) in LPI-treated eyes compared with control eyes. At the 14-year visit, LPI-treated eyes had severer nuclear cataract, higher IOP, larger angle width and limbal anterior chamber depth (LACD) than control eyes. Higher IOP, shallower LACD, and central anterior chamber depth (CACD) were associated with an increased risk of developing endpoints in control eyes. In the treated group, eyes with higher IOP, shallower LACD, or less IOP elevation after dark room-prone provocative tests (DRPPT) were more likely to develop PAC after LPI. CONCLUSIONS: Despite a two-third decrease in PAC incidence after LPI, the cumulative risk of PAC was relatively low in the community-based PACS population over 14 years. Apart from IOP, IOP elevation after DRPPT, CACD, and LACD, more risk factors are needed to achieve precise prediction of PAC occurrence and guide clinical practice.'], ['Ectopic expression of a mechanosensitive channel confers spatiotemporal resolution to ultrasound stimulations of neurons for visual restoration.', 'Nature nanotechnology', '2023 Apr 3', '37012508', 'Remote and precisely controlled activation of the brain is a fundamental challenge in the development of brain-machine interfaces for neurological treatments.

Here we combined the expression of large-conductance mechanosensitive ion channels with uncustomary high-frequency ultrasonic stimulation to activate retinal or cortical neurons over millisecond durations at a spatiotemporal resolution and acoustic energy deposit compatible with vision restoration. The in vivo sonogenetic activation of the visual cortex generated a behaviour associated with light perception.

Studies have shown that CXCL12 can aggravate inflammatory symptoms in the central nervous system (CNS). Evidence also indicates that CXCL12 can promote the repair of myelin sheaths in the CNS in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). Here, we investigated the function of CXCL12 in CNS inflammation by upregulating CXCL12 in the spinal cord and subsequently inducing EAE. MATERIALS AND METHODS: CXCL12 upregulation in the spinal cords of Lewis rats was induced by the injection of adeno-associated virus 9 (AAV9)/eGFP-P2A-CXCL12 after intrathecal catheter implantation. Twenty-one days after AAV injection, EAE was induced and clinical score was collected; Immunofluorescence staining, WB and LFB-PAS staining were used to evaluate the effect of CXCL12 upregulation. In the in vitro study, oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) were harvested, cultured with CXCL12 and AMD3100, and subjected to immunofluorescence staining for functional assessment. RESULTS: CXCL12 was upregulated in the lumbar enlargement of the spinal cord by AAV injection. In each stage of EAE, upregulation of CXCL12 significantly alleviated clinical scores by inhibiting leukocyte infiltration and promoting remyelination. In contrast, the addition of AMD3100, which is a CXCR4 antagonist, inhibited the effect of CXCL12. In vitro, 10 ng/ml CXCL12 promoted the differentiation of OPCs into oligodendrocytes. CONCLUSION: AAV-mediated upregulation of CXCL12 in the CNS can alleviate the clinical signs and symptoms of EAE and significantly decrease the infiltration of leukocytes in the peak stage of EAE. CXCL12 can promote the maturation and differentiation of OPCs into oligodendrocytes in vitro. These data indicate that CXCL12 effectively promotes remyelination in the spinal cord and decreases the signs and symptoms of EAE.'], ['Iron deficiency and overload in men and woman of reproductive age, and pregnant women.', 'Reproductive toxicology (Elmsford, N.Y.)', '2023 Apr 5', '37023911', 'Iron is an essential micronutrient for human biology and health, but high iron levels can be dangerous.

METHODS: The dataset consisted of 2-dimensional (2-D) ICGA and 3-dimensional (3-D) SD-OCT images which were spatially registered and manually segmented by clinicians. A deep learning-based hybrid algorithm called PCV-Net was developed for automatic joint segmentation of biomarkers. The PCV-Net consisted of a 2-D segmentation branch for ICGA and 3-D segmentation branch for SD-OCT. We developed fusion attention modules to connect the 2-D and 3-D branches for effective use of the spatial correspondence between the imaging modalities by sharing learned features. We also used self-supervised pretraining and ensembling to further enhance the performance of the algorithm without the need for additional datasets. We compared the proposed PCV-Net to several alternative model variants. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The PCV-Net was evaluated based on the Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) of the segmentations and the Pearson's correlation and absolute difference of the clinical measurements obtained from the segmentations. Manual grading was used as the gold standard. RESULTS: The PCV-Net showed good performance compared to manual grading and alternative model variants based on both quantitative and qualitative analyses. Compared to the baseline variant, PCV-Net improved the DSC by 0.04 to 0.43 across the different biomarkers, increased the correlations, and decreased the absolute differences of clinical measurements of interest. Specifically, the largest average (mean +/- standard error) DSC improvement was for intraretinal fluid, from 0.02 +/- 0.00 (baseline variant) to 0.45 +/- 0.06 (PCV-Net).

Most such mutations consist of missense variants. METHODS: In this study, we present a precision medicine workflow combining next-generation sequencing (NGS) diagnostics, molecular etiology analysis, and personalized drug discovery. FINDINGS: We describe a patient carrying a de novo intronic mutation (NM_020988.3:c.724-8G>A), leading to epilepsy-negative encephalopathy with motor dysfunction from the second decade. Our data show that this mutation creates a novel splice acceptor site that in turn causes an in-frame insertion of two amino acid residues, Pro-Gln, within the regulatory switch III region of Galphao. This insertion misconfigures the switch III loop and creates novel interactions with the catalytic switch II region, resulting in increased GTP uptake, defective GTP hydrolysis, and aberrant interactions with effector proteins. In contrast, intracellular localization, Gbetagamma interactions, and G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) coupling of the Galphao[insPQ] mutant protein remain unchanged.

The impacts of baseline sensory status on LE, LS and SRH were assessed using univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses. A linear regression analysis with generalized estimating equations (GEE) was used to assess the association between time-varying sensory statuses with LE, LS and SRH over 8 years after being adjusted with multi-confounding factors. RESULTS: Participants with SIs had significantly lower level of LE, LS, and SRH, compared to those who were free of SI. All kinds of SIs were significantly associated with LE, LS, and SRH according to cross-sectional data. The correlations between SIs and LE or SRH over 8 years were also noticed. However, only SHI and DSI were found to be significantly associated with LS according to longitudinal data (all p values < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Sensory impairments had explicitly detrimental effects on subjective wellbeing status over time among middle-aged and older Chinese population.'], ['Fibrosis in neovascular age-related macular degeneration: A review of definitions based on clinical imaging.', 'Survey of ophthalmology', '2023 Apr 4', '37023894', 'Despite the success of antiangiogenic therapy in controlling exudation in neovascular age-related macular degeneration (nAMD), the involvement of the outer retina in fibrosis results in gradual vision loss over time. The development of drugs that prevent or ameliorate fibrosis in nAMD requires that it is accurately detected and quantified with reliable endpoints and identification of robust biomarkers. Achievement of such an aim is currently challenging due to the lack of a consensus definition of fibrosis in nAMD. As a first step towards the establishment of a clear definition of fibrosis, we provide an extensive overview of the imaging modalities and criteria used to characterize fibrosis in nAMD. We observed variety in the selection of individual and combinations of imaging modalities, and criteria for detection. We also observed heterogeneity in classification systems and severity scales for fibrosis. The most commonly used imaging modalities were color fundus photography (CFP), fluorescence angiography (FA) and optical coherence tomography (OCT). A multimodal approach was frequently utilized. Our review suggests that OCT offers a more detailed, objective and sensitive characterization than CFP/FA. Thus, we recommend it as a primary modality for fibrosis evaluation. This review provides a basis for future discussions to reach a consensus definition using standardized terms based on a detailed characterization of fibrosis, its presence and evolution, and taking into consideration impact on visual function. Achieving this goal is of paramount importance for the development of antifibrotic therapies.'], ['Therapeutic outcomes of mycophenolate mofetil and glucocorticoid in thyroid-associated ophthalmopathy patients.', 'Frontiers in endocrinology', '2023', '37025403', \"OBJECTIVE: To analyze the efficacy of mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) and glucocorticoid administration in patients with thyroid-associated ophthalmopathy (TAO). METHODS: Sixty patients with moderate to severe TAO treated in Jingzhou Central Hospital from January 2022 to June 2022 were selected and enrtolled in this study. The subjects were divided into experimental group (n=30) and control group (n=30) based on the random number table method. Glucocorticoid pulse therapy was provided in the control group, while MMF was given in the experimental group on the basis of Control group. Clinical activity score (CAS), quality of life (QOL), visual acuity, eyelid fissure width, intraocular pressure, and degree of exophthalmos were observed at the time of admission and at the 12(th) week and 24(th) post-treatment weeks. We compared the immune function (TRAb, IL-6, and CD4+/CD8+) of the two groups pre-treatment and 24 weeks post-treatment, and evaluated the clinical therapeutic effect. RESULTS: The clinical effective rates at 12 and 24 weeks in the experimental group were higher (73.3% and 83.3%) than those in the control group (46.7% and 60.0%) (P <0.05). After 12 weeks of treatment, patients' CAS scores, and bilateral lid fissure width decreased and right eye visual acuity increased in the control group compared with those before treatment (P < 0.05); further, after 24 weeks of treatment, patients' QOL scores and bilateral visual acuity increased and CAS scores, bilateral lid fissure width and proptosis decreased compared with those before treatment, and patients' QOL scores, CAS scores and bilateral proptosis improved more than those at 12 weeks of treatment (P <0.05). Additionally, greater improvements were observed in the patients' QOL and CAS scores, and proptosis after 24-week treatment than after 12-week treatment (P<0.05). In the experimental group, the QOL score and binocular visual acuity increased, whereas the CAS score, intraocular pressure, lid width, and proptosis decreased after 12 weeks of treatment as compared to the values of these parameters in the pre-treatment period (P < 0.05); after 24 weeks of treatment, greater improvements were established in the ocular-related indexes improved compared to the pre-treatment period and after 12 weeks of treatment (P < 0.05). After 12 weeks of treatment, the patients in the experimental group had more considerable improvements in the right visual acuity, right intraocular pressure, and left lid fissure width than the control group (P < 0.05); at 24 weeks of treatment, patients in the experimental group had greater improvements in the QOL score, bilateral visual acuity, intraocular pressure, bilateral lid fissure width, and bilateral proptosis than the control group (P < 0.05). No significant differences were found in the values of TRAb, IL-6, and CD4+/CD8+ between the two groups before treatment (P>0.05); the values of TRAb, IL-6, and CD4+/CD8+ in the experimental group was significantly lower than those before treatment and in the control group after 24weeks of treatment. (P>0.05). No statistically significant difference was observed in the incidence of liver damage and menstrual disorders between the two groups during the 24 weeks of treatment (P>0.05). CONCLUSION: The combination of oral MMF and glucocorticoid shock therapy is an effective drug for the treatment of patients with moderately active TAO.\"]]\n"
